Symbols can be words, images, body language, sounds, etc.[1]\", \"Language is symbolic in more ways than can be summarized in a sentence or paragraph, but generally we are talking about how symbols can stand for something else, how they can be used to communicate, and how they can be imbued with meaning.\", \"For a simple example of symbolic language: the word cat is symbolic of the idea of a cat, a dollar is a symbol of $1 of economic value, the word yes or a nod is a symbol of confirmation, a grimace is a symbol of disapproval, and a smiley face emoji is a symbol of happiness \\ud83d\\ude42 .\", \"If I want to communicate happiness, it can be as simple as offering symbolic emoji to a friend. That simple symbol doesn\\u2019t have just one meaning, but it has a fairly common meaning, and general \\u201ccommunication value\\u201d (it works for conveying ideas between people).\", \"That said, most symbols, and our use of them in practice, is anything but simple.\", \"Most symbols mean many different things at once, and can mean different things to different people depending on a number of controllable and\\u00a0uncontrollable factors (like context, subtext, and the past experiences of those communicating).\", \"Luckily, we can use a mix of symbols to better illustrate complex ideas quickly. Unfortunately, using a single term or even a mix of terms for a deep complex concept can lead to a world of communication problems.\", \"Consider the following points:\", \"Semantics, Semiotics, and Symbols: Semantics is the study of meaning. When we say \\u201clanguage is symbolic\\u201d we aren\\u2019t talking about \\u201cwhat we say\\u201d (what symbols we use), but \\u201cwhat we\\u00a0mean\\u201d (what the symbols we use mean; what we are trying to communicate). Language is symbolic in that the symbols we use have a\\u00a0deeper \\u201csymbolic and semantic\\u201d meaning beyond their literal meaning. The study of this can be called \\u201csemiotics\\u201d (meaning \\u201cobservant of signs\\u201d; a Greek term popularized by John Locke; see below). Another way to say this is a signifier (a symbol) can signify (represent) meaning other than its literal meaning or even its common dictionary meaning (AKA signification).\", \"TIP:\\u00a0For a simple example of what isn\\u2019t a symbol: A rock is a rock. I can look at it, it is what it is, i\\u2019m not using it to communicate. It isn\\u2019t symbolic of a rock, it is a rock.\\u00a0If a person can sense it, if\\u00a0it has any meaning that isn\\u2019t purely literal, if it has any \\u201ccommunication value\\u201d, it is a symbol. If a person can sense it, but it only has its literal meaning, and has no communication value, it isn\\u2019t a symbol. In this way, almost all our communication tools are symbolic, we\\u00a0use a mix of complex symbols with differing meanings to express specific ideas (or more specifically to illicit specific understandings in those with which we communicate).\", \"NOTES: While on the topic of rocks and symbolism, we can say that if\\u00a0a symbol is \\u201cheavy with meaning\\u201d or conveys \\u201cheavy concepts\\u201d the symbol \\u201chas weight\\u201d. Symbols can be very powerful, think about national symbols like a country\\u2019s flag, they are emblems that\\u00a0people identify with and rally around. The same goes for historic figures, events, laws, gestures, photos, acts, songs, and more. When we pair together symbols, it creates a type of religion, in terms of the state, it creates a civic religion. Here one should note that symbols don\\u2019t just have direct communication value, they have indirect value as well (for example, if one creates an identity\\u00a0out of a symbol created or imbued with meaning by someone they never met. More on all this below.\", \"TIP:\\u00a0An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book\\u00a0(a book published in two volumes) by father of liberalism John Locke is largely\\u00a0about the symbolic nature of language (Book II and III specifically discuss this, for example see the chapter \\u201cOf the Signification of Words\\u201c; the rest of the books deals with\\u00a0epistemology, \\u201cgiving names to things\\u201c, semiotics, and more). To Locke, logic (one \\u201csphere\\u201d of human understanding, the others for Locke and many others including the Greeks being physics and ethics) was the \\u201crealm of signs\\u201d (consider all logic is expressed by signs). More recent works on semantics and symbolic language include\\u00a0Kenneth Burke\\u2018s\\u00a0Language as Symbolic Action. The philosophy of language has been explored by many great thinkers from Aristotle, to\\u00a0Hume and Kant, to Chomsky.\", \"Jung and Signs and Symbols: Speaking of semantics, there is a Jungian mode of thought where we can call \\u201cthings that stand for actual things\\u201d signs, and we can call \\u201cthings that stand for metaphysical concepts\\u201d symbols. In our terms, we\\u2019ll consider symbols and signs as analogous. Jung is a master of symbology and signs in terms of their metaphysics (just like Locke is a master in the empirical sense and Chomsky is a modern master in the logical sense), consider checking out Jung\\u2019s\\u00a0work![2]\", \"TIP: Symbols can be categorized in a number of ways. One way is to consider the Kant-inspired\\u00a0four basic categories of human understanding, the physical, logical, ethical, and moral.\", \"In its simplest form, every letter used to form our formal written and spoken language is a symbol.

Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.\", \"Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and dialects. Natural languages are spoken or signed, but any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli\\u00a0\\u2013 for example, in whistling, signed, or braille. This is because human language is modality-independent. Depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, \\\"language\\\" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings. Oral, manual and tactile languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.\", \"Human language has the properties of productivity and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. Language is thought to have originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality.[1][2] This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.\", \"Languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as English, Russian and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin, Bodo and the other Chinese languages, and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, and Zulu, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil and Telugu. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.\", \"\", \"\", \"The English word language derives ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *dn\\u0325\\u01f5\\u02b0w\\u00e9h\\u2082s \\\"tongue, speech, language\\\" through Latin lingua, \\\"language; tongue\\\", and Old French language.[3] The word is sometimes used to refer to codes, ciphers, and other kinds of artificially constructed communication systems such as formally defined computer languages used for computer programming. Unlike conventional human languages, a formal language in this sense is a system of signs for encoding and decoding information. This article specifically concerns the properties of natural human language as it is studied in the discipline of linguistics.\", \"As an object of linguistic study, \\\"language\\\" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. \\\"French\\\". The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word langage for language as a concept, langue as a specific instance of a language system, and parole for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.[4]\", \"When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.[5] These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.[6] Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.[7]\", \"During the Enlightenment and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world\\u00a0\\u2013 asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.[8]\", \"One definition sees language primarily as the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.[9][10]\", \"Another definition sees language as a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.[11] This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure,[12] and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.[13]\", \"Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.[14] Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.[15] By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics.[16][17] In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.\", \"Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. Functional theories of grammar explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was \\\"tailored\\\" to serve the communicative needs of its users.[18][19]\", \"This view of language is associated with the study of language in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.[17] In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.[20]\", \"A number of features, many of which were described by Charles Hockett and called design features[21] set human language apart from other known systems of communication, such as those used by non-human animals.\", \"Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.[22] In contrast, human language is open-ended and productive, meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).[23] However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the chestnut-crowned babbler, is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations. [24] Additionally, pied babblers have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements. [25]\", \"Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a bonobo named Kanzi learned to express itself using a set of symbolic lexigrams. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,[note 1] none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.[26]\", \"Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ grammatical and semantic categories, such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.[26] Human language is also unique in having the property of recursivity: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in \\\"[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]\\\") or a clause can contain another clause (as in \\\"[I see [the dog is running]]\\\").[2] Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as modality independent. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas sign languages and writing use the visual modality, and braille writing uses the tactile modality.[27]\", \"Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.[23]\", \"Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.[29]\", \"One prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins is linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky.[29] Chomsky proposes that \\\"some random mutation took place, maybe after some strange cosmic ray shower, and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain.\\\"[30] Though cautioning against taking this story too literally, Chomsky insists that \\\"it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language.\\\"[30]\", \"Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the precedents to be animal cognition,[10] whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as having developed from animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.[31] Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from music, a view already espoused by Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt, and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist Steven Mithen.[32] Stephen Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years[33] and that:\", \"Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered\\u00a0... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.[34]\", \"Because language emerged in the early prehistory of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.[35]\", \"It was mostly undisputed that pre-human australopithecines did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in great apes in general. However, a 2017 study on Ardipithecus ramidus challenges this belief.[36] Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus Homo some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with Homo erectus (1.8 million years ago) or Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens with the Upper Paleolithic revolution less than 100,000 years ago.[37][38]\", \"The study of language, linguistics, has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in India more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the Brahmi script. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.[39]\", \"The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the comparative method.[40]\", \"The formal study of language is often considered to have started in India with P\\u0101\\u1e47ini, the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology. However, Sumerian scribes already studied the differences between Sumerian and Akkadian grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.[41]\", \"In the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics.[42] The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.[12]\", \"By introducing a distinction between diachronic and synchronic analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).[43]\", \"In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky formulated the generative theory of language. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.[44]\", \"In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.[17][note 2] The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.[45]\", \"Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.[46] The study of the genetic bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital language disorder if affected by mutations.[47]\", \"The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called neurolinguistics.[48]\", \"Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which is located in the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.[49] They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.[50][51]\", \"With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology to study language processing in individuals without impairments.[48]\", \"Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce sound, which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the ear drum. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (larynx), and the upper vocal tract\\u00a0\\u2013 the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.[52]\", \"The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.[53]\", \"Consonants and vowel segments combine to form syllables, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically, these different segments are characterized by different formant structures, that are visible in a spectrogram of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.[53][54]\", \"Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.[53] Vowels are called close when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel [i] (English \\\"ee\\\"), or open when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel [a] (English \\\"ah\\\"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as [u] (English \\\"oo\\\"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are rounded as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between [i] (unrounded front vowel such as English \\\"ee\\\") and [y] (rounded front vowel such as German \\\"\\u00fc\\\").[55]\", \"Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, velum, uvula, or glottis. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by manner of articulation, or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called occlusive or stop, or different degrees of aperture creating fricatives and approximants. Consonants can also be either voiced or unvoiced, depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English [s] in bus (unvoiced sibilant) from [z] in buzz (voiced sibilant).[56]\", \"Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.[54]\", \"By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.[57]\", \"When described as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.[58]\", \"Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.[58]\", \"The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called syntax or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called semantics.[59] The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.[60]\", \"Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.\", \"Thus, languages must have a vocabulary of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign \\\"dog\\\" denotes, for example, a member of the species Canis familiaris. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the lexicon, and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a lexeme. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of grammatical categories.[61]\", \"All languages contain the semantic structure of predication: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign truth values to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. \\\"[x [is y]]\\\" or \\\"[x [does y]]\\\". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of pragmatics.[61]\", \"Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology.[62] The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics.[63] In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.[57]\", \"Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called phonemes.[64] Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called minimal pair. In English, for example, the words bat [b\\u00e6t] and pat [p\\u02b0\\u00e6t] form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between /b/ and /p/ differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds [p] and [b] (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between aspirated and non-aspirated pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like Korean and Hindi do: the unaspirated /p/ in spin [sp\\u026an] and the aspirated /p/ in pin [p\\u02b0\\u026an] are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called allophones), whereas in Mandarin Chinese, the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words [p\\u02b0\\u00e1] 'crouch' and [p\\u00e1] 'eight' (the accent above the \\u00e1 means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).[65]\", \"All spoken languages have phonemes of at least two different categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables.[53] As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called suprasegmental.[66] Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirah\\u00e3 language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes.[65] In sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.[67][68][69]\", \"Writing systems represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word,[70] and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.\", \"Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.[71]\", \"In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the International Phonetic Alphabet, designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.[72]\", \"Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.[73]\", \"Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.[74] Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.[75]\", \"Languages organize their parts of speech into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as \\\"dog\\\" and \\\"song\\\", are usually called nouns. The second, which includes \\\"run\\\" and \\\"sing\\\", are called verbs. Another common category is the adjective: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"big\\\". Word classes can be \\\"open\\\" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively \\\"closed\\\" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. \\\"saddened\\\") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in \\\"noun-like\\\"). In other languages such as Korean, the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.[76]\", \"Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct predicates, while nouns are used as arguments of predicates. In a sentence such as \\\"Sally runs\\\", the predicate is \\\"runs\\\", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument \\\"Sally\\\". Some verbs such as \\\"curse\\\" can take two arguments, e.g. \\\"Sally cursed John\\\". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called intransitive, while a predicate that can take two arguments is called transitive.[77]\", \"Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as conjunctions like \\\"and\\\" that serve to join two sentences, articles that introduce a noun, interjections such as \\\"wow!\\\", or ideophones like \\\"splash\\\" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have classifiers that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in Japanese, the general noun classifier for humans is nin (\\u4eba), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:[78]\", \"For trees, it would be:\", \"In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called morphology. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several morphemes. For instance, the English word \\\"unexpected\\\" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes \\\"un-\\\", \\\"expect\\\" and \\\"-ed\\\".[79]\", \"Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called roots, or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or affixes can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: prefixes precede the root, suffixes follow the root, and infixes are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word \\\"run\\\", which in the past tense is \\\"ran\\\". This process is called ablaut. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of inflection, which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of derivation, which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb \\\"sing\\\" has the inflectional forms \\\"singing\\\" and \\\"sung\\\", which are both verbs, and the derivational form \\\"singer\\\", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix \\\"-er\\\".[80]\", \"Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called isolating, or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word bonus, or \\\"good\\\", consists of the root bon-, meaning \\\"good\\\", and the suffix -us, which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. These languages are called fusional languages, because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is Turkish, where for example, the word evlerinizden, or \\\"from your houses\\\", consists of the morphemes, ev-ler-iniz-den with the meanings house-plural-your-from. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called polysynthetic languages. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh means I didn't understand it consisting of morphemes na-fahm-id-am-esh with the meanings, \\\"negation.understand.past.I.it\\\". As another example with more complexity, in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq, which means \\\"He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer\\\", the word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings, \\\"reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative\\\", and except for the morpheme tuntu (\\\"reindeer\\\") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.[81]\", \"Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called agreement. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective bonus, or \\\"good\\\", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the Basque phrase ikusi nauzu, or \\\"you saw me\\\", the past tense auxiliary verb n-au-zu (similar to English \\\"do\\\") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the n- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the \\u2013 zu suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as \\\"see you-did-me\\\"[82]\", \"Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as \\\"I love you\\\" is meaningful, but \\\"*love you I\\\" is not.[note 3] Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.[83] For example, in English, the two sentences \\\"the slaves were cursing the master\\\" and \\\"the master was cursing the slaves\\\" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in Latin, both Dominus servos vituperabat and Servos vituperabat dominus mean \\\"the master was reprimanding the slaves\\\", because servos, or \\\"slaves\\\", is in the accusative case, showing that they are the grammatical object of the sentence, and dominus, or \\\"master\\\", is in the nominative case, showing that he is the subject.[84]\", \"Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of inverse word order in questions, which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase \\\"John is talking to Lucy\\\" is turned into a question, it becomes \\\"Who is John talking to?\\\", and not \\\"John is talking to who?\\\". The latter example may be used as a way of placing special emphasis on \\\"who\\\", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called phrases, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.[85] To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence \\\"the cat sat on the mat\\\". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.[86]\", \"The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, \\\"the cat\\\" is one phrase, and \\\"on the mat\\\" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: \\\"[And] on the mat, the cat sat\\\".[86] There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.[17]\", \"Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.[87] For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic word order, the relative order of the verb, and its constituents in a normal indicative sentence. In English, the basic order is SVO: \\\"The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)\\\", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the Australian language Gamilaraay would be d\\u032auyugu n\\u032aama d\\u032aayn yi\\u02d0y (snake man bit), SOV.[88] Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of prepositions or postpositions. Such correlations are called implicational universals.[89] For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the SOV type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.[90]\", \"All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the nominative-accusative word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences (\\\"I run\\\") and transitive sentences (\\\"I love you\\\") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun I. Some languages, called ergative, Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as \\\"I run\\\", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of \\\"me run\\\". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun \\\"I\\\" be used.[88] In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the tripartite type.[91]\", \"The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, \\\"language universals\\\", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.[18]\", \"While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.[18] Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.[93]\", \"However, languages differ from biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.[94]\", \"The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is located in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called deixis, which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, \\\"I\\\" (which designates the person speaking), \\\"now\\\" (which designates the moment of speaking), and \\\"here\\\" (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.[95] Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of \\\"naming\\\", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of \\\"pronouncing someone man and wife\\\", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called speech acts, although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing.[96]\", \"The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, \\\"Can you reach the salt?\\\", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called conversational implicatures. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring communicative competence in a language.[97]\", \"All healthy, normally developing human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring sign or oral languages.[98] This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In The Descent of Man, naturalist Charles Darwin called this process \\\"an instinctive tendency to acquire an art\\\".[10]\", \"First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different speech sounds. Around six months of age, a child will begin babbling, producing the speech sounds or handshapes of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average vocabulary of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 words. A child's first utterances are holophrases (literally \\\"whole-sentences\\\"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce telegraphic speech, or short sentences that are less grammatically complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.[99][100] Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn fetuses are capable of language acquisition to some degree.[101][102]\", \"Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.[103]\", \"Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different \\\"cultures of speaking.\\\" Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly sociolinguists, ethnolinguists, and linguistic anthropologists have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between speech communities.[104]\", \"Linguists use the term \\\"varieties\\\" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined dialects as well as the jargons or styles of subcultures. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.[105]\", \"Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.[106]\", \"However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between social classes, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language Dyirbal, a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.[107] Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of \\\"social deixis\\\", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.[108] In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as \\\"Mrs.\\\", \\\"boy\\\", \\\"Doctor\\\", or \\\"Your Honor\\\", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as Thai, Burmese, and Javanese, different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.[108]\", \"Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called writing systems.\", \"The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.[109]\", \"The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late 4th millennium BC. The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400\\u20133200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BC. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of cultural diffusion. A similar debate exists for the Chinese script, which developed around 1200 BC. The pre-Columbian Mesoamerican writing systems (including among others Olmec and Maya scripts) are generally believed to have had independent origins.[71]\", \"All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be \\\"decay\\\" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.[110]\", \"Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire phonological system. Sound change can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or phonetic feature by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *b\\u02b0 became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *b in turn became /p/, and the previous *p became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.[111]\", \"Another example is the Great Vowel Shift in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.[112]\", \"Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as idioms or particular constructions become grammaticalized. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of Caribbean Spanish the final /s/ has eroded away. Since Standard Spanish uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the second person subject \\\"you\\\" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun t\\u00fa. This means that the sentence \\\"what's your name\\\" is \\u00bfcomo te llamas? [\\u02c8komo te \\u02c8jamas] in Standard Spanish, but [\\u02c8komo \\u02c8tu te \\u02c8jama] in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.[113] Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English \\\"going to\\\" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. I'm gonna).\", \"Language change may be motivated by \\\"language internal\\\" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to drift towards more common types.[114] Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with ideologies, and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.[115]\", \"One important source of language change is contact and resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or varieties interact on a regular basis.[116] Multilingualism is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.[117]\", \"When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of language areas in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the Balkan language area, the Mesoamerican language area, and the Ethiopian language area. Also, larger areas such as South Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific areal features.[118][119]\", \"Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages; others are Krey\\u00f2l ayisyen, the French-based creole language spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language Cree and French.[120]\", \"SIL Ethnologue defines a \\\"living language\\\" as \\\"one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language\\\". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of \\\"language\\\", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and dialects. As of 2016, Ethnologue cataloged 7,097 living human languages.[122] The Ethnologue establishes linguistic groups based on studies of mutual intelligibility, and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the Danish language that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and Jutish) by the Ethnologue.[121]\", \"According to the Ethnologue, 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the Ethnologue (2009 figures).[121]\", \"There is no clear distinction between a language and a dialect, notwithstanding a famous aphorism attributed to linguist Max Weinreich that \\\"a language is a dialect with an army and navy\\\".[123] For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. Hakka, Cantonese and Mandarin are, for example, often classified as \\\"dialects\\\" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than Swedish is from Norwegian. Before the Yugoslav civil war, Serbo-Croatian was considered a single language with two dialects, but now Croatian and Serbian are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive writing systems, or degree of mutual intelligibility.[124]\", \"The world's languages can be grouped into language families consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of language isolates: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are Basque, spoken in Europe, Zuni of New Mexico, Pur\\u00e9pecha of Mexico, Ainu of Japan, Burushaski of Pakistan, and many others.[125]\", \"The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the Indo-European languages, spoken by 46% of the world's population.[126] This family includes major world languages like English, Spanish, Russian, and Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the Eurasian Migration Period (c. 400\\u2013800 AD),[citation needed] and subsequently through the European colonial expansion, which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the Americas and much of Africa. The Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by 20%[126] of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and hundreds of smaller languages.[127]\", \"Africa is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the Niger-Congo language family, which includes such languages as Swahili, Shona, and Yoruba. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.[126] A similar number of people speak the Afroasiatic languages, which include the populous Semitic languages such as Arabic, Hebrew language, and the languages of the Sahara region, such as the Berber languages and Hausa.[127]\", \"The Austronesian languages are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from Madagascar to maritime Southeast Asia all the way to Oceania.[126] It includes such languages as Malagasy, M\\u0101ori, Samoan, and many of the indigenous languages of Indonesia and Taiwan. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the Dravidian languages of South Asia (among them Kannada Tamil and Telugu), the Turkic languages of Central Asia (such as Turkish), the Austroasiatic (among them Khmer), and Tai\\u2013Kadai languages of Southeast Asia (including Thai).[127]\", \"The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, Papua New Guinea, West Africa, and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the Quechumaran, Arawak, and Tupi-Guarani families of South America, the Uto-Aztecan, Oto-Manguean, and Mayan of Mesoamerica, and the Na-Dene, Iroquoian, and Algonquian language families of North America. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the Pama-Nyungan family, whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.[125]\", \"Language endangerment occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of globalization and neo-colonialism, where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.[128]\", \"The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000[129] and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50\\u201390% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.[128] The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.[128]\", \"The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: \\\"safe\\\", \\\"vulnerable\\\" (not spoken by children outside the home), \\\"definitely endangered\\\" (not spoken by children), \\\"severely endangered\\\" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and \\\"critically endangered\\\" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often semi-speakers). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common lingua franca, such as English or Esperanto, there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the tower of Babel in the Old Testament, that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,[28] but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the Yugoslav and American Civil War, or the genocide of Rwanda, whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.[130]\", \"Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous speech communities. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.[131]\", \"\"]}]", "unit test": "[{\"content\": [\"Definitions\", \" (uncountable)\", \"\", \"Create and save customized flash cards.

In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure. In object-oriented programming, a unit is often an entire interface, such as a class, but could be an individual method.[2] Unit tests are short code fragments[3] created by programmers or occasionally by white box testers during the development process. It forms the basis for component testing.[4]\", \"Ideally, each test case is independent from the others. Substitutes such as method stubs, mock objects,[5] fakes, and test harnesses can be used to assist testing a module in isolation. Unit tests are typically written and run by software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended.\", \"Because some classes may have references to other classes, testing a class can frequently spill over into testing another class. A common example of this is classes that depend on a database: in order to test the class, the tester often writes code that interacts with the database. This is a mistake, because a unit test should usually not go outside of its own class boundary, and especially should not cross such process/network boundaries because this can introduce unacceptable performance problems to the unit test-suite. Crossing such unit boundaries turns unit tests into integration tests, and when such test cases fail, it may be unclear which component is causing the failure. Instead, the software developer should create an abstract interface around the database queries, and then implement that interface with their own mock object. By abstracting this necessary attachment from the code (temporarily reducing the net effective coupling), the independent unit can be more thoroughly tested than may have been previously achieved. This results in a higher-quality unit that is also more maintainable.\", \"Unit testing is commonly automated, but may still be performed manually. The IEEE does not favor one over the other.[6] The objective in unit testing is to isolate a unit and validate its correctness. A manual approach to unit testing may employ a step-by-step instructional document. However, automation is efficient for achieving this, and enables the many benefits listed in this article. Conversely, if not planned carefully, a careless manual unit test case may execute as an integration test case that involves many software components, and thus preclude the achievement of most if not all of the goals established for unit testing.\", \"To fully realize the effect of isolation while using an automated approach, the unit or code body under test is executed within a framework outside of its natural environment. In other words, it is executed outside of the product or calling context for which it was originally created. Testing in such an isolated manner reveals unnecessary dependencies between the code being tested and other units or data spaces in the product. These dependencies can then be eliminated.\", \"Using an automation framework, the developer codes criteria, or a test oracle or result that is known to be good, into the test to verify the unit's correctness. During test case execution, the framework logs tests that fail any criterion. Many frameworks will also automatically flag these failed test cases and report them in a summary. Depending upon the severity of a failure, the framework may halt subsequent testing.\", \"As a consequence, unit testing is traditionally a motivator for programmers to create decoupled and cohesive code bodies. This practice promotes healthy habits in software development. Design patterns, unit testing, and refactoring often work together so that the best solution may emerge.\", \"Parameterized unit tests (PUTs) are tests that take parameters. Unlike traditional unit tests, which are usually closed methods, PUTs take any set of parameters. PUTs have been supported by TestNG, JUnit and various .NET test frameworks. Suitable parameters for the unit tests may be supplied manually or in some cases are automatically generated by the test framework. Testing tools like QuickCheck exist to generate test inputs for PUTs.\", \"The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct.[1] A unit test provides a strict, written contract that the piece of code must satisfy. As a result, it affords several benefits.\", \"Unit testing finds problems early in the development cycle. This includes both bugs in the programmer's implementation and flaws or missing parts of the specification for the unit. The process of writing a thorough set of tests forces the author to think through inputs, outputs, and error conditions, and thus more crisply define the unit's desired behavior. The cost of finding a bug before coding begins or when the code is first written is considerably lower than the cost of detecting, identifying, and correcting the bug later; bugs may also cause problems for the end-users of the software.[7][8][9] Code can be impossible or difficult to test if poorly written, thus unit testing can force developers to structure functions and objects in better ways.\", \"In test-driven development (TDD), which is frequently used in both extreme programming and scrum, unit tests are created before the code itself is written. When the tests pass, that code is considered complete. The same unit tests are run against that function frequently as the larger code base is developed either as the code is changed or via an automated process with the build. If the unit tests fail, it is considered to be a bug either in the changed code or the tests themselves. The unit tests then allow the location of the fault or failure to be easily traced. Since the unit tests alert the development team of the problem before handing the code off to testers or clients, it is still early in the development process.\", \"Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code or upgrade system libraries at a later date, and make sure the module still works correctly (e.g., in regression testing). The procedure is to write test cases for all functions and methods so that whenever a change causes a fault, it can be quickly identified. Unit tests detect changes which may break a design contract.\", \"Unit testing may reduce uncertainty in the units themselves and can be used in a bottom-up testing style approach. By testing the parts of a program first and then testing the sum of its parts, integration testing becomes much easier.[citation needed]\", \"Unit testing provides a sort of living documentation of the system. Developers looking to learn what functionality is provided by a unit, and how to use it, can look at the unit tests to gain a basic understanding of the unit's interface (API).\", \"Unit test cases embody characteristics that are critical to the success of the unit. These characteristics can indicate appropriate/inappropriate use of a unit as well as negative behaviors that are to be trapped by the unit. A unit test case, in and of itself, documents these critical characteristics, although many software development environments do not rely solely upon code to document the product in development.\", \"When software is developed using a test-driven approach, the combination of writing the unit test to specify the interface plus the refactoring activities performed after the test is passing, may take the place of formal design. Each unit test can be seen as a design element specifying classes, methods, and observable behaviour.\", \"Testing will not catch every error in the program, because it cannot evaluate every execution path in any but the most trivial programs. This problem is a superset of the halting problem, which is undecidable. The same is true for unit testing. Additionally, unit testing by definition only tests the functionality of the units themselves. Therefore, it will not catch integration errors or broader system-level errors (such as functions performed across multiple units, or non-functional test areas such as performance). Unit testing should be done in conjunction with other software testing activities, as they can only show the presence or absence of particular errors; they cannot prove a complete absence of errors. To guarantee correct behavior for every execution path and every possible input, and ensure the absence of errors, other techniques are required, namely the application of formal methods to proving that a software component has no unexpected behavior.\", \"An elaborate hierarchy of unit tests does not equal integration testing. Integration with peripheral units should be included in integration tests, but not in unit tests.[citation needed] Integration testing typically still relies heavily on humans testing manually; high-level or global-scope testing can be difficult to automate, such that manual testing often appears faster and cheaper.[citation needed]\", \"Software testing is a combinatorial problem. For example, every Boolean decision statement requires at least two tests: one with an outcome of \\\"true\\\" and one with an outcome of \\\"false\\\". As a result, for every line of code written, programmers often need 3 to 5 lines of test code.[10] This obviously takes time and its investment may not be worth the effort. There are also many problems that cannot easily be tested at all \\u2013 for example those that are nondeterministic or involve multiple threads. In addition, code for a unit test is likely to be at least as buggy as the code it is testing. Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month quotes: \\\"Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.\\\"[11] Meaning, if two chronometers contradict, how do you know which one is correct?\", \"Another challenge related to writing the unit tests is the difficulty of setting up realistic and useful tests. It is necessary to create relevant initial conditions so the part of the application being tested behaves like part of the complete system. If these initial conditions are not set correctly, the test will not be exercising the code in a realistic context, which diminishes the value and accuracy of unit test results.[12]\", \"To obtain the intended benefits from unit testing, rigorous discipline is needed throughout the software development process. It is essential to keep careful records not only of the tests that have been performed, but also of all changes that have been made to the source code of this or any other unit in the software. Use of a version control system is essential. If a later version of the unit fails a particular test that it had previously passed, the version-control software can provide a list of the source code changes (if any) that have been applied to the unit since that time.\", \"It is also essential to implement a sustainable process for ensuring that test case failures are reviewed regularly and addressed immediately.[13] If such a process is not implemented and ingrained into the team's workflow, the application will evolve out of sync with the unit test suite, increasing false positives and reducing the effectiveness of the test suite.\", \"Unit testing embedded system software presents a unique challenge: Because the software is being developed on a different platform than the one it will eventually run on, you cannot readily run a test program in the actual deployment environment, as is possible with desktop programs.[14]\", \"Unit tests tend to be easiest when a method has input parameters and some output. It is not as easy to create unit tests when a major function of the method is to interact with something external to the application. For example, a method that will work with a database might require a mock up of database interactions to be created, which probably won't be as comprehensive as the real database interactions.[15]\", \"Here is a set of test cases that specify a number of elements of the implementation. First, that there must be an interface called Adder, and an implementing class with a zero-argument constructor called AdderImpl. It goes on to assert that the Adder interface should have a method called add, with two integer parameters, which returns another integer. It also specifies the behaviour of this method for a small range of values over a number of test methods.\", \"In this case the unit tests, having been written first, act as a design document specifying the form and behaviour of a desired solution, but not the implementation details, which are left for the programmer. Following the \\\"do the simplest thing that could possibly work\\\" practice, the easiest solution that will make the test pass is shown below.\", \"Using unit-tests as a design specification has one significant advantage over other design methods: The design document (the unit-tests themselves) can itself be used to verify the implementation. The tests will never pass unless the developer implements a solution according to the design.\", \"Unit testing lacks some of the accessibility of a diagrammatic specification such as a UML diagram, but they may be generated from the unit test using automated tools. Most modern languages have free tools (usually available as extensions to IDEs). Free tools, like those based on the xUnit framework, outsource to another system the graphical rendering of a view for human consumption.\", \"Unit testing is the cornerstone of extreme programming, which relies on an automated unit testing framework. This automated unit testing framework can be either third party, e.g., xUnit, or created within the development group.\", \"Extreme programming uses the creation of unit tests for test-driven development. The developer writes a unit test that exposes either a software requirement or a defect. This test will fail because either the requirement isn't implemented yet, or because it intentionally exposes a defect in the existing code. Then, the developer writes the simplest code to make the test, along with other tests, pass.\", \"Most code in a system is unit tested, but not necessarily all paths through the code. Extreme programming mandates a \\\"test everything that can possibly break\\\" strategy, over the traditional \\\"test every execution path\\\" method. This leads developers to develop fewer tests than classical methods, but this isn't really a problem, more a restatement of fact, as classical methods have rarely ever been followed methodically enough for all execution paths to have been thoroughly tested.[citation needed] Extreme programming simply recognizes that testing is rarely exhaustive (because it is often too expensive and time-consuming to be economically viable) and provides guidance on how to effectively focus limited resources.\", \"Crucially, the test code is considered a first class project artifact in that it is maintained at the same quality as the implementation code, with all duplication removed. Developers release unit testing code to the code repository in conjunction with the code it tests. Extreme programming's thorough unit testing allows the benefits mentioned above, such as simpler and more confident code development and refactoring, simplified code integration, accurate documentation, and more modular designs. These unit tests are also constantly run as a form of regression test.\", \"Unit testing is also critical to the concept of Emergent Design. As emergent design is heavily dependent upon refactoring, unit tests are an integral component.[16]\", \"Unit testing frameworks are most often third-party products that are not distributed as part of the compiler suite. They help simplify the process of unit testing, having been developed for a wide variety of languages. Examples of testing frameworks include open source solutions such as the various code-driven testing frameworks known collectively as xUnit, and proprietary/commercial solutions such as Cantata for C/C++Typemock Isolator.NET/Isolator++, TBrun, JustMock, Parasoft Development Testing (Jtest, Parasoft C/C++test, dotTEST), Testwell CTA++ and VectorCAST/C++.\", \"It is generally possible to perform unit testing without the support of a specific framework by writing client code that exercises the units under test and uses assertions, exception handling, or other control flow mechanisms to signal failure. Unit testing without a framework is valuable in that there is a barrier to entry for the adoption of unit testing; having scant unit tests is hardly better than having none at all, whereas once a framework is in place, adding unit tests becomes relatively easy.[17] In some frameworks many advanced unit test features are missing or must be hand-coded.\", \"Some programming languages directly support unit testing. Their grammar allows the direct declaration of unit tests without importing a library (whether third party or standard). Additionally, the boolean conditions of the unit tests can be expressed in the same syntax as boolean expressions used in non-unit test code, such as what is used for if and while statements.\", \"Languages with built-in unit testing support include:\", \"Some languages without built-in unit-testing support have very good unit testing libraries/frameworks.

Often times, these methodologies are applied in the context of larger software systems or applications and less in the context of WordPress-based projects (though it is getting better!)\", \"Frankly, the development community is a bit divided on automated software testing \\u2013 you have some people who think you should have tests for 100% of all of your code, some believe that 80% is sufficient, some 50%, and some are content with 20% or so. Whatever the case may be, this article is not about arguing a case for the level of tests you should have in your project nor is it taking a position on general software testing.\", \"Instead, we're going to take a look at what's required to get up and running with unit testing your WordPress development projects. We're going to be approaching this series from the perspective of an absolute beginner so that we can understand the benefits of unit testing and how to configure our environment to support unit testing libraries so that we can begin to do this in our future work. Finally, all of this will be done by building and testing a simple, testable plugin from the ground up.\", \"Before we get started setting up our environment and writing any code, let's define exactly what unit testing is, why it's worth doing, and how to get started in incorporating it in our projects.\", \"At a high-level, unit testing refers to the practice of testing certain functions and areas \\u2013 or units \\u2013 of our code. This gives us the ability to verify that our functions work as expected. That is to say that for any function and given a set of inputs, we can determine if the function is returning the proper values and will gracefully handle failures during the course of execution should invalid input be provided.\", \"Ultimately, this helps us to identify failures in our algorithms and/or logic to help improve the quality of the code that composes a certain function. As you begin to write more and more tests, you end up creating a suite of tests that you can run at any time during development to continually verify the quality of your work.\", \"A second advantage to approaching development from a unit testing perspective is that you'll likely be writing code that is easy to test. Since unit testing requires that your code be easily testable, it means that your code must support this particular type of evaluation. As such, you're more likely to have a higher number of smaller, more focused functions that provide a single operation on a set of data rather than large functions performing a number of different operations.\", \"A third advantage for writing solid unit tests and well-tested code is that you can prevent future changes from breaking functionality. Since you're testing your code as you introduce your functionality, you're going to begin developing a suite of test cases that can be run each time you work on your logic. When a failure happens, you know that you have something to address.\", \"Of course, this comes at the expense of investing time to write a suite of tests early in development, but as the project grows you can simply run the tests that you've developed to ensure that existing functionality isn't broken when new functionality is introduced.\", \"One of the best ways to get started with unit testing is to do so in the context of a practical application. Throughout this two-part series we're going to be building a simple plugin and writing tests to cover all of the functionality.\", \"First, let's plan the project: We're going to be writing a small plugin that will add a simple message at the top of a single post that welcomes the user based on how they've found a specific blog post. The idea is very similar to Welcome Reader but it won't include near as much functionality \\u2013 we're simply building a demo to learn the ins and outs of testing.\", \"Anyway, here's how the plugin will work:\", \"Straightforward enough, right? This will also provide a foundation on which to add custom messages for other services and further extend our unit testing abilities should you want to do so.\", \"In order to unit test our code, we're going to need a third-party library that we include into our project that will actually execute the tests we write. In this series, we're going to be using PHPUnit. You can grab a copy of it here.\", \"Next, we need to prepare our development environment, stub out our plugin, and include the necessary libraries for testing our code. This article is assuming that you already have a functional WordPress installation up and running.\", \"So, first, let's prepare the plugin directory:\", \"Here's the skeleton for the plugin that we'll be creating:\", \"At this point, you should be able to navigate to the \\\"Plugins\\\" in your WordPress Dashboard and see an entry for \\\"Hello Reader.\\\" Obviously, this plugin doesn't do anything just yet \\u2013 we'll be focusing on that (as well as why we're leveraging the $GLOBALS array) in the next article.\", \"Finally, let's setup the testing framework so that we'll be able to write our tests. First, we're going to need to install PHPUnit and then we'll need to install the WordPress Tests.\", \"Note: The next section will require doing some work with the terminal and will likely require that you issue a few commands to create symbolic links. I've attempted to make this as straightforward and easy as possible, but every operating system and configuration will be different. Please follow carefully and I invite you to share your instructions for your operating systems in the comments.\", \"PHPUnit is a unit test framework package specifically for PHP. The WordPress Tests and the framework that we're going to be using for writing our WordPress tests depend on this. Unfortunately, installation varies based on your platform.

You can grab the package from GitHub. If you're comfortable cloning the repository, then feel free to do that; otherwise, simply download an archive of the project and extract it into the test directory that we created earlier in this article.\", \"Before actually running the tests, we'll need to create a config file for running WordPress tests. This is exactly like editing the wp-config.php file with a new WordPress installation, but we're doing it for a test database instead. Below, I've pasted my configuration file and have added comments. I'll be sure to commit this to this article's GitHub repository, too.\", \"To verify that you've installed the tests properly, you can run the following command in your Terminal:\", \"\\r\\n\\t$ /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.3.6/bin/phpunit all\", \"If you happen to get an error, it's because the WordPress tests are trying to use a socket to the MySQL database rather than the one that's used by MAMP.

After all, we as humans make these sort of judgments on a daily basis.

A little like the anchor text in an incoming link would have a positive effect on that keyword in the SERPS or if the positive results from reputable outgoing links affects the content of the page as a whole. By having another test word which is not hyperlinked, we can compare to see if there is a difference in effect between the linked and the non-linked keyword.\", \"The idea is simple.

This runs counter to the philosophy that used be popular in the industry, that of hoarding PageRank.  You do read less about the notion of hoarding PageRank these days than you used to, but I still think that many publishers do not fully understand why outbound links are important.\", \"\\r\\n\", \"It all comes down to what you need to do to receive authoritative links.  You have to get inside the head of the person who is going to make the decision about linking to you or not.  If you don't understand their mindset, your chances of success go down dramatically.  Remember that these people are going to the sole judge and jury in terms of deciding whether or not to give you a link.\", \"\\r\\n\", \"For example, someone that works at MIT lives and breathes an academic environment.

It just does not feel or look right to them.\", \"As a brief aside, earlier this week I reviewed a web site that had been heavily over-optimized. For example, it had links that had been crudely stuffed into the home page and pointed to lower level pages that added no real value. They were there purely for the purpose of linking to a page with anchor text that corresponded to a key search term.\", \"When people go off the deep end with SEO, you end up with sites that don't even read correctly.  An end user who did not know about SEO who read such a site would literally be scratching their head when they see the site.  This certainly lowers the ability of the site to close business.  In addition, such an over-optimized site has no chance of getting links from an authoritative site.  None.\", \"This phenomenon is not limited to the academic world.  You will encounter the same conditions at government sites, or amongst people at major media sites, such as the NY times.  The nature and depth of the types of research may be different, but the idea of citing sources and looking for high quality content to link to remains the same.\", \"You can extend this notion further.  Any time you look at a site and see that they have gone to the trouble of creating authoritative content (and cite other sources as well), you know you have someone that is going to expect similar behavior from any site they would consider linking to.\", \"It's kind of a club, really.  Once you become a recognized authority in a field, you are a part of the club. Along with other authoritative sources in the same and closely related fields, you will start to get links flowing without a tremendous amount of effort.\", \"Publishers of authoritative sites almost always care about their users.  They spend time thinking about increasing content quality and adding new content to their site.  They are not afraid that when they link to someone else, they will lose traffic that will convert into business for them.  They know that the links they send to others will mostly be used by people that are not finding on their site what they are looking for (so there really is very little to lose).\", \"\\r\\nPicking Sites to Link To\\r\\n\", \"The first thing that needs to happen is that you have to have the authoritative mindset.  As outlined above, this means that you embark on a deliberate campaign to achieve a status of being an authority in your field, and demonstrating that authority in what you publish.

Data may be transmitted using several technologies, including dial-up, DSL, cable modem, wireless or dedicated high-speed interconnects. \", \"Typically, ISPs also provide their customers with the ability to communicate with one another by providing Internet email accounts, usually with numerous email addresses at the customer\\u2019s discretion. Other services, such as telephone and television services, may be provided as well. The services and service combinations may be unique to each ISP. \", \"An Internet service provider is also known as an Internet access provider (IAP).\", \"The Internet began as a closed network between government research laboratories and universities and colleges. As universities and colleges began giving Internet access to their faculty and other employees, ISPs were created to provide Internet access to those employees at home and elsewhere. The first ISP began in 1990 as The World, based in Brookline, Massachusetts. \", \"Individual customers and businesses pay ISPs for Internet Access. ISPs are interconnected to one another at network access points. In turn, ISPs pay other, larger ISPs for their Internet access, which in turn pay still other ISPs. This cascades multiple times until transmissions reach a Tier 1 carrier, which is an ISP capable of reaching every other network on the Internet without purchasing IP transit or paying settlements. However, it is difficult to determine the status of a network because the business agreements to pay settlements are not made public. \", \"However, the situation is more complex than simply a single connection established to an upstream ISP. ISPs may have more than one point of presence (PoP), which is an access point to the Internet comprised of a physical location housing servers, routers, ATM switches and digital/analog call aggregators. Some ISPs have thousands of PoPs. Multiple PoPs may have separate connections to an upstream ISP.

They both stand for the same concept.\\\"[28] On 12 March 2015, the FCC released the specific details of the net neutrality rules.[29][30][31] On 13 April 2015, the FCC published the final rule on its new \\\"Net Neutrality\\\" regulations.[32][33] These rules went into effect on 12 June 2015.[34]\", \"Upon becoming FCC chairman in April 2017, Ajit Pai proposed an end to net neutrality, awaiting votes from the commission.[35][36] On 21 November 2017, Pai announced that a vote will be held by FCC members on 14 December on whether to repeal the policy.[37]\", \" ISPs provide Internet access, employing a range of technologies to connect users to their network.[38] Available technologies have ranged from computer modems with acoustic couplers to telephone lines, to television cable (CATV), Wi-Fi, and fiber optics.\", \"For users and small businesses, traditional options include copper wires to provide dial-up, DSL, typically asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), cable modem or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) (typically basic rate interface).

Furthermore, in some countries ISPs are subject to monitoring by intelligence agencies. In the U.S., a controversial National Security Agency program known as PRISM provides for broad monitoring of Internet users traffic and has raised concerns about potential violation of the privacy protections in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[46][47] Modern ISPs integrate a wide array of surveillance and packet sniffing equipment into their networks, which then feeds the data to law-enforcement/intelligence networks (such as DCSNet in the United States, or SORM[48] in Russia) allowing monitoring of Internet traffic in real time.\"]}]"}, "1": {"run time": "[{\"content\": [\"Runtime is the period of time when a program is running.

This is in contrast to the runtime lifecycle phase of a program, during which the runtime system is in operation. Most languages have some form of runtime system, which implements control over the order in which work that was specified in terms of the language gets performed. Over the years, the meaning of the term 'runtime system' has been expanded to include nearly any behaviors that are dynamically determined during execution.\", \"\", \"\", \"Every programming language specifies an execution model, and many implement at least part of that model in a runtime system. Runtime system behavior is, arguably, defined as any behavior not directly attributable to the program itself. This definition includes, as part of the runtime system, things such as putting parameters onto the stack before a function call, the behavior of disk I/O, and parallel execution related behaviors.\", \"By this definition, essentially every language has a runtime system, including compiled languages, interpreted languages, and embedded domain-specific languages. Even API invoked stand alone execution models such as Pthreads have a runtime system that is the implementation of execution model's behavior.\", \"Most scholarly papers on runtime systems focus on the implementation details of parallel runtime systems. A notable example of a parallel runtime system is that of Cilk, a popular parallel programming model.[1] In addition, the proto-runtime toolkit was created to simplify the creation of parallel runtime systems.[2]\", \"In addition to the execution model behavior, a runtime system may also perform support services such as type checking, debugging, or code generation and optimization.[3]\", \"The runtime system is also the gateway by which a running program interacts with the runtime environment, which contains not only state values that are accessible during program execution, but also active entities that can be interacted with during program execution like disk drives and people via keyboards. For example, environment variables are features of many operating systems, and are part of the runtime environment; a running program can access them via the runtime system. Likewise, hardware devices such as a DVD drive are active entities that a program can interact with via a runtime system.\", \"A unique application of a runtime environment (RTE) is within an operating system (OS) that only allows that RTE to run, meaning from boot until power-down the entire OS is dedicated to only the application(s) running within that RTE. Any other code that tries to run or any failures in the application(s) break the RTE which breaks the OS which stops all processing and requires a re-boot. If the boot is from read-only memory, an extremely secure, simple, single-mission system is created.\", \"As a simple example of a basic runtime system, the runtime system of the C language is a particular set of instructions inserted into the executable image by the compiler. Among other things, these instructions manage the processor stack, create space for local variables, and copy function-call parameters onto the top of the stack. There are often no clear criteria for deciding which language behavior is considered inside the runtime system versus which behavior is \\\"compiled\\\". In this case, the reason that C's stack behavior is part of the runtime system, as opposed to part of a keyword of the language, is that it is systematic, maintaining the state of the stack throughout a program's execution. The systematic behavior implements the execution model of the language, as opposed to implementing semantics of particular keywords which are directly translated into code that computes results.\", \"Another example, which illuminates the nature of a runtime system, is the case of using an application programming interface (API) to interact with a runtime system. The calls to that API look the same as calls to a regular software library, however at some point during the call the execution model changes. The runtime system implements an execution model different from that of the language the library is written in terms of. A person reading the code of a normal library would be able to understand the library's behavior by just knowing the language the library was written in. However, a person reading the code of the API that invokes a runtime system would not be able to understand the behavior of the API call just by knowing the language the call was written in. At some point, via some mechanism, the execution model stops being that of the language the call is written in and switches over to being the execution model implemented by the runtime system. For example, the trap instruction is one method of switching execution models. This difference is what distinguishes an API-invoked execution model, such as POSIX threads, from a usual software library. Both POSIX threads calls and software library calls are invoked via an API, but POSIX threads behavior cannot be understood in terms of the language of the call. Rather, POSIX threads calls bring into play an outside execution model, which is implemented by the POSIX threads runtime system (this runtime system is often the OS kernel).\", \"Some compiled or interpreted languages provide an interface that allows application code to interact directly with the runtime system. An example is the Thread class in the Java language, which allows code (that is animated by one thread) to do things such as start and stop other threads. Normally, core aspects of a language's behavior such as task scheduling and resource management are not accessible in this fashion.\", \"Higher-level behaviors implemented by a runtime system may include tasks such as drawing text on the screen or making an Internet connection. It is often the case that operating systems provide these kinds of behaviors as well, and when available, the runtime system is implemented as an abstraction layer that translates the invocation of the runtime system into an invocation of the operating system. This hides the complexity or variations in the services offered by different operating systems. This also implies that the OS kernel can itself be viewed as a runtime system, and that the set of OS calls that invoke OS behaviors may be viewed as interactions with a runtime system.\", \"In the limit, the runtime system may provide services such as a P-code machine or virtual machine, that hide even the processor's instruction set. This is the approach followed by many interpreted languages such as AWK, and some languages like Java, which are meant to be compiled into some machine-independent intermediate representation code (such as bytecode). This arrangement greatly simplifies the task of language implementation and its adaptation to different machines, and improves efficiency of sophisticated language features such as reflection. It also allows the same program to be executed on any machine without an explicit recompiling step, a feature that has become very important since the proliferation of the World Wide Web. To speed up execution, some runtime systems feature just-in-time compilation to machine code.\", \"At the other extreme, the physical CPU itself can be viewed as an implementation of the runtime system of a specific assembly language. In this view, the execution model is implemented by the physical CPU and memory systems. As an analogy, runtime systems for higher-level languages are themselves implemented using some other languages. This creates a hierarchy of runtime systems, with the CPU itself\\u2014or actually its inner digital logic structures that determine things like program counter advancement and scheduling of instructions\\u2014acting as the lowest-level runtime system.\", \"A modern aspect of runtime systems is parallel execution behaviors, such as the behaviors exhibited by mutex constructs in Pthreads and parallel section constructs in OpenMP. A runtime system with such parallel execution behaviors may be modularized according to the proto-runtime approach.\", \"Notable early examples of runtime systems are the interpreters for BASIC and Lisp. These environments also included a garbage collector. Forth is an early example of a language that was designed to be compiled into intermediate representation code; its runtime system was a virtual machine that interpreted that code. Another popular, if theoretical, example is Donald Knuth's MIX computer.\", \"In C and later languages that supported dynamic memory allocation, the runtime system also included a library that managed the program's memory pool.\", \"In the object-oriented programming languages, the runtime system was often also responsible for dynamic type checking and resolving method references.\"]}]", "disk": "[{\"content\": [\"Gain access to thousands of additional definitions and advanced search features\\u2014ad free!

Although the album was completed in the spring of 1991, it was not released until 1992. The reason that the album's release date was pushed back was because Bad Religion was not happy with the artwork and packaging, and in order to release it, they went through ideas that were scrapped. Generator was the band's first release with drummer Bobby Schayer, who replaced Pete Finestone during the Against the Grain tour. It is also Bad Religion's fourth and last album not to display their classic font on the cover.\\nLike Bad Religion's first five albums, Epitaph Records released a remastered version of Generator on April 6, 2004, with two exclusive tracks that were taken from the split 7\\\" with Noam Chomsky issued by Maximum Rock'N Roll in 1991. On the same day, they released a DVD reissue of their long-out of print live video Along the Way, which was also released in 1992. These versions feature Finestone on drums, making it his final recordings with Bad Religion. As of 2008, the original CD version of the album is out of print.\\nA video was made for \\\"Atomic Garden\\\". It is available for watching at Epitaph web site.

generator[1] is a device that converts motive power (mechanical energy) into electrical power for use in an external circuit. Sources of mechanical energy include steam turbines, gas turbines, water turbines, internal combustion engines and even hand cranks. The first electromagnetic generator, the Faraday disk, was built in 1831 by British scientist Michael Faraday. Generators provide nearly all of the power for electric power grids.\", \"The reverse conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is done by an electric motor, and motors and generators have many similarities. Many motors can be mechanically driven to generate electricity and frequently make acceptable manual generators.\", \"\", \"\", \"Electromagnetic generators fall into one of two broad categories, dynamos and alternators.\", \"Mechanically a generator consists of a rotating part and a stationary part\", \"One of these parts generates a magnetic field, the other has a wire winding in which the changing field induces an electric current\", \"The armature can be on either the rotor or the stator, depending on the design, with the field coil or magnet on the other part.\", \"Before the connection between magnetism and electricity was discovered, electrostatic generators were invented. They operated on electrostatic principles, by using moving electrically charged belts, plates, and disks that carried charge to a high potential electrode. The charge was generated using either of two mechanisms: electrostatic induction or the triboelectric effect. Such generators generated very high voltage and low current. Because of their inefficiency and the difficulty of insulating machines that produced very high voltages, electrostatic generators had low power ratings, and were never used for generation of commercially significant quantities of electric power. Their only practical applications were to power early X-ray tubes, and later in some atomic particle accelerators.\", \"The operating principle of electromagnetic generators was discovered in the years of 1831\\u20131832 by Michael Faraday. The principle later called Faraday's law, is that an electromotive force is generated in an electrical conductor which encircles a varying magnetic flux.\", \"He also built the first electromagnetic generator, called the Faraday disk; a type of homopolar generator, using a copper disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. It produced a small DC voltage.\", \"This design was inefficient, due to self-cancelling counterflows of current in regions of the disk that were not under the influence of the magnetic field. While current was induced directly underneath the magnet, the current would circulate backwards in regions that were outside the influence of the magnetic field. This counterflow limited the power output to the pickup wires, and induced waste heating of the copper disc. Later homopolar generators would solve this problem by using an array of magnets arranged around the disc perimeter to maintain a steady field effect in one current-flow direction.\", \"Another disadvantage was that the output voltage was very low, due to the single current path through the magnetic flux. Experimenters found that using multiple turns of wire in a coil could produce higher, more useful voltages. Since the output voltage is proportional to the number of turns, generators could be easily designed to produce any desired voltage by varying the number of turns. Wire windings became a basic feature of all subsequent generator designs.\", \"Independently of Faraday, the Hungarian \\u00c1nyos Jedlik started experimenting in 1827 with the electromagnetic rotating devices which he called electromagnetic self-rotors. In the prototype of the single-pole electric starter (finished between 1852 and 1854) both the stationary and the revolving parts were electromagnetic. It was also the discovery of the principle of dynamo self-excitation,[2] which replaced permanent magnet designs. He also may have formulated the concept of the dynamo in 1861 (before Siemens and Wheatstone) but didn't patent it as he thought he wasn't the first to realize this.[3]\", \"A coil of wire rotating in a magnetic field produces a current which changes direction with each 180\\u00b0 rotation, an alternating current (AC). However many early uses of electricity required direct current (DC). In the first practical electric generators, called dynamos, the AC was converted into DC with a commutator, a set of rotating switch contacts on the armature shaft. The commutator reversed the connection of the armature winding to the circuit every 180\\u00b0 rotation of the shaft, creating a pulsing DC current. One of the first dynamos was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832.\", \"The dynamo was the first electrical generator capable of delivering power for industry. The Woolrich Electrical Generator of 1844, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, is the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process.[4] It was used by the firm of Elkingtons for commercial electroplating.[5][6][7]\", \"The modern dynamo, fit for use in industrial applications, was invented independently by Sir Charles Wheatstone, Werner von Siemens and Samuel Alfred Varley. Varley took out a patent on 24 December 1866, while Siemens and Wheatstone both announced their discoveries on 17 January 1867, the latter delivering a paper on his discovery to the Royal Society.\", \"The \\\"dynamo-electric machine\\\" employed self-powering electromagnetic field coils rather than permanent magnets to create the stator field.[8] Wheatstone's design was similar to Siemens', with the difference that in the Siemens design the stator electromagnets were in series with the rotor, but in Wheatstone's design they were in parallel.[9] The use of electromagnets rather than permanent magnets greatly increased the power output of a dynamo and enabled high power generation for the first time. This invention led directly to the first major industrial uses of electricity. For example, in the 1870s Siemens used electromagnetic dynamos to power electric arc furnaces for the production of metals and other materials.\", \"The dynamo machine that was developed consisted of a stationary structure, which provides the magnetic field, and a set of rotating windings which turn within that field. On larger machines the constant magnetic field is provided by one or more electromagnets, which are usually called field coils.\", \"Large power generation dynamos are now rarely seen due to the now nearly universal use of alternating current for power distribution. Before the adoption of AC, very large direct-current dynamos were the only means of power generation and distribution. AC has come to dominate due to the ability of AC to be easily transformed to and from very high voltages to permit low losses over large distances.\", \"Through a series of discoveries, the dynamo was succeeded by many later inventions, especially the AC alternator, which was capable of generating alternating current.\", \"Alternating current generating systems were known in simple forms from Michael Faraday's original discovery of the magnetic induction of electric current. Faraday himself built an early alternator. His machine was a \\\"rotating rectangle\\\", whose operation was heteropolar - each active conductor passed successively through regions where the magnetic field was in opposite directions.[10]\", \"Large two-phase alternating current generators were built by a British electrician, J.E.H. Gordon, in 1882. The first public demonstration of an \\\"alternator system\\\" was given by William Stanley, Jr., an employee of Westinghouse Electric in 1886.[11]\", \"Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti established Ferranti, Thompson and Ince in 1882, to market his Ferranti-Thompson Alternator, invented with the help of renowned physicist Lord Kelvin.[12] His early alternators produced frequencies between 100 and 300 Hz. Ferranti went on to design the Deptford Power Station for the London Electric Supply Corporation in 1887 using an alternating current system. On its completion in 1891, it was the first truly modern power station, supplying high-voltage AC power that was then \\\"stepped down\\\" for consumer use on each street. This basic system remains in use today around the world.\", \"After 1891, polyphase alternators were introduced to supply currents of multiple differing phases.[13] Later alternators were designed for varying alternating-current frequencies between sixteen and about one hundred hertz, for use with arc lighting, incandescent lighting and electric motors.[14]\", \"As the requirements for larger scale power generation increased, a new limitation rose: the magnetic fields available from permanent magnets. Diverting a small amount of the power generated by the generator to an electromagnetic field coil allowed the generator to produce substantially more power. This concept was dubbed self-excitation.\", \"The field coils are connected in series or parallel with the armature winding. When the generator first starts to turn, the small amount of remanent magnetism present in the iron core provides a magnetic field to get it started, generating a small current in the armature. This flows through the field coils, creating a larger magnetic field which generates a larger armature current. This \\\"bootstrap\\\" process continues until the magnetic field in the core levels off due to saturation and the generator reaches a steady state power output.\", \"Very large power station generators often utilize a separate smaller generator to excite the field coils of the larger. In the event of a severe widespread power outage where islanding of power stations has occurred, the stations may need to perform a black start to excite the fields of their largest generators, in order to restore customer power service.[15]\", \"A homopolar generator is a DC electrical generator comprising an electrically conductive disc or cylinder rotating in a plane perpendicular to a uniform static magnetic field. A potential difference is created between the center of the disc and the rim (or ends of the cylinder), the electrical polarity depending on the direction of rotation and the orientation of the field.\", \"It is also known as a unipolar generator, acyclic generator, disk dynamo, or Faraday disc. The voltage is typically low, on the order of a few volts in the case of small demonstration models, but large research generators can produce hundreds of volts, and some systems have multiple generators in series to produce an even larger voltage.[16] They are unusual in that they can produce tremendous electric current, some more than a million amperes, because the homopolar generator can be made to have very low internal resistance.\", \"A magnetohydrodynamic generator directly extracts electric power from moving hot gases through a magnetic field, without the use of rotating electromagnetic machinery. MHD generators were originally developed because the output of a plasma MHD generator is a flame, well able to heat the boilers of a steam power plant. The first practical design was the AVCO Mk. 25, developed in 1965. The U.S. government funded substantial development, culminating in a 25 MW demonstration plant in 1987. In the Soviet Union from 1972 until the late 1980s, the MHD plant U 25 was in regular commercial operation on the Moscow power system with a rating of 25 MW, the largest MHD plant rating in the world at that time.[17] MHD generators operated as a topping cycle are currently (2007) less efficient than combined cycle gas turbines.\", \"Induction AC motors may be used as generators, turning mechanical energy into electric current. Induction generators operate by mechanically turning their rotor faster than the synchronous speed, giving negative slip. A regular AC asynchronous motor usually can be used as a generator, without any internal modifications. Induction generators are useful in applications such as minihydro power plants, wind turbines, or in reducing high-pressure gas streams to lower pressure, because they can recover energy with relatively simple controls. They do not require an exciter circuit because the rotating magnetic field is provided by induction from the stator circuit. They also do not require speed governor equipment as they inherently operate at the connected grid frequency.\", \"To operate, an induction generator must be excited with a leading voltage; this is usually done by connection to an electrical grid, or sometimes they are self-excited by using phase correcting capacitors.\", \"In the simplest form of linear electric generator, a sliding magnet moves back and forth through a solenoid - a spool of copper wire. An alternating current is induced in the loops of wire by Faraday's law of induction each time the magnet slides through. This type of generator is used in the Faraday flashlight. Larger linear electricity generators are used in wave power schemes.\", \"Many renewable energy efforts attempt to harvest natural sources of mechanical energy (wind, tides, etc.) to produce electricity. Because these sources fluctuate in power applied, standard generators using permanent magnets and fixed windings would deliver unregulated voltage and frequency. The overhead of regulation (whether before the generator via gear reduction or after generation by electrical means) is high in proportion to the naturally-derived energy available.\", \"New generator designs such as the asynchronous or induction singly-fed generator, the doubly fed generator, or the brushless wound-rotor doubly fed generator are seeing success in variable speed constant frequency applications, such as wind turbines or other renewable energy technologies. These systems thus offer cost, reliability and efficiency benefits in certain use cases.\", \"Motor vehicles require electrical energy to power their instrumentation, keep the engine itself operating, and recharge their batteries. Until about the 1960s motor vehicles tended to use DC generators with electromechanical regulators. Following the historical trend above and for many of the same reasons, these have now been replaced by alternators with built-in rectifier circuits.\", \"Bicycles require energy to power running lights and other equipment. There are two common kinds of generator in use on bicycles: bottle dynamos which engage the bicycle's tire on an as-needed basis, and hub dynamos which are directly attached to the bicycle's drive train. In reality, neither of these is a dynamo, properly speaking - they are small permanent-magnet alternators. Some electric bicycles are capable of regenerative braking, where the drive motor is used as a generator to recover some energy during braking.\", \"Sailing boats may use a water- or wind-powered generator to trickle-charge the batteries. A small propeller, wind turbine or impeller is connected to a low-power generator to supply currents at typical wind or cruising speeds.\", \"An engine-generator is the combination of an electrical generator and an engine (prime mover) mounted together to form a single piece of self-contained equipment. The engines used are usually piston engines, but gas turbines can also be used. And there are even hybrid diesel-gas units, called dual-fuel units. Many different versions of engine-generators are available - ranging from very small portable petrol powered sets to large turbine installations. The primary advantage of engine-generators is the ability to independently supply electricity, allowing the units to serve as backup power solutions.[18]\", \"A generator can also be driven by human muscle power (for instance, in field radio station equipment).\", \"Human powered direct current generators are commercially available, and have been the project of some DIY enthusiasts. Typically operated by means of pedal power, a converted bicycle trainer, or a foot pump, such generators can be practically used to charge batteries, and in some cases are designed with an integral inverter. An average \\\"healthy human\\\" can produce a steady 75 Watts (0.1 horsepower) for a full eight hour period, while a \\\"first class athlete\\\" can produce approximately 298 Watts (0.4 horsepower) for a similar period. At the end of which an undetermined period of rest and recovery will be required. At 298 Watts the average \\\"healthy human\\\" becomes exhausted within 10 minutes.[20] The net electrical power that can be produced will be less, due to the efficiency of the generator. Portable radio receivers with a crank are made to reduce battery purchase requirements, see clockwork radio. During the mid 20th century, pedal powered radios were used throughout the Australian outback, to provide schooling (School of the Air), medical and other needs in remote stations and towns.\", \"Designed to measure shaft speed, a tachogenerator is a device which produces an output voltage proportional to that speed. Tachogenerators are frequently used to power tachometers to measure the speeds of electric motors, engines, and the equipment they power. speed. With precise construction and design, generators can be built to produce very precise voltages for certain ranges of shaft speeds.[citation needed]\", \"An equivalent circuit of a generator and load is shown in the adjacent diagram.

In particular, inductance can be added to allow for the machine's windings and magnetic leakage flux,[21] but a full representation can become much more complex than this.[22]\"]}]"}, "0": {"system support": "[{\"content\": [\"Gain access to thousands of additional definitions and advanced search features\\u2014ad free!

Business firms and other organizations rely on information systems to carry out and manage their operations, interact with their customers and suppliers, and compete in the marketplace. Information systems are used to run interorganizational supply chains and electronic markets. For instance, corporations use information systems to process financial accounts, to manage their human resources, and to reach their potential customers with online promotions. Many major companies are built entirely around information systems. These include eBay, a largely auction marketplace; Amazon, an expanding electronic mall and provider of cloud computing services; Alibaba, a business-to-business e-marketplace; and Google, a search engine company that derives most of its revenue from keyword advertising on Internet searches. Governments deploy information systems to provide services cost-effectively to citizens. Digital goods\\u2014such as electronic books, video products, and software\\u2014and online services, such as gaming and social networking, are delivered with information systems. Individuals rely on information systems, generally Internet-based, for conducting much of their personal lives: for socializing, study, shopping, banking, and entertainment.\", \"As major new technologies for recording and processing information were invented over the millennia, new capabilities appeared, and people became empowered. The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century and the invention of a mechanical calculator by Blaise Pascal in the 17th century are but two examples. These inventions led to a profound revolution in the ability to record, process, disseminate, and reach for information and knowledge. This led, in turn, to even deeper changes in individual lives, business organization, and human governance.\", \"The first large-scale mechanical information system was Herman Hollerith\\u2019s census tabulator. Invented in time to process the 1890 U.S. census, Hollerith\\u2019s machine represented a major step in automation, as well as an inspiration to develop computerized information systems.\", \"One of the first computers used for such information processing was the UNIVAC I, installed at the U.S. Bureau of the Census in 1951 for administrative use and at General Electric in 1954 for commercial use. Beginning in the late 1970s, personal computers brought some of the advantages of information systems to small businesses and to individuals. Early in the same decade the Internet began its expansion as the global network of networks. In 1991 the World Wide Web, invented by Tim Berners-Lee as a means to access the interlinked information stored in the globally dispersed computers connected by the Internet, began operation and became the principal service delivered on the network. The global penetration of the Internet and the Web has enabled access to information and other resources and facilitated the forming of relationships among people and organizations on an unprecedented scale. The progress of electronic commerce over the Internet has resulted in a dramatic growth in digital interpersonal communications (via e-mail and social networks), distribution of products (software, music, e-books, and movies), and business transactions (buying, selling, and advertising on the Web). With the worldwide spread of smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other computer-based mobile devices, all of which are connected by wireless communication networks, information systems have been extended to support mobility as the natural human condition.\", \"As information systems enabled more diverse human activities, they exerted a profound influence over society. These systems quickened the pace of daily activities, enabled people to develop and maintain new and often more-rewarding relationships, affected the structure and mix of organizations, changed the type of products bought, and influenced the nature of work. Information and knowledge became vital economic resources. Yet, along with new opportunities, the dependence on information systems brought new threats. Intensive industry innovation and academic research continually develop new opportunities while aiming to contain the threats.\", \"\\u2026hieroglyphic script on papyrus, contained information about legal and economic transactions. In these and other early document collections (e.g., those of China produced during the Shang dynasty in the 2nd millennium bc and Buddhist collections in India dating to the 5th century bc), it is difficult to separate the concepts\\u2026\\n\", \"The main components of information systems are computer hardware and software, telecommunications, databases and data warehouses, human resources, and procedures. The hardware, software, and telecommunications constitute information technology (IT), which is now ingrained in the operations and management of organizations.\", \"Today throughout the world even the smallest firms, as well as many households, own or lease computers. Individuals may own multiple computers in the form of smartphones, tablets, and other wearable devices. Large organizations typically employ distributed computer systems, from powerful parallel-processing servers located in data centres to widely dispersed personal computers and mobile devices, integrated into the organizational information systems. Sensors are becoming ever more widely distributed throughout the physical and biological environment to gather data and, in many cases, to effect control via devices known as actuators. Together with the peripheral equipment\\u2014such as magnetic or solid-state storage disks, input-output devices, and telecommunications gear\\u2014these constitute the hardware of information systems. The cost of hardware has steadily and rapidly decreased, while processing speed and storage capacity have increased vastly. This development has been occurring under Moore\\u2019s law: the power of the microprocessors at the heart of computing devices has been doubling approximately every 18 to 24 months. However, hardware\\u2019s use of electric power and its environmental impact are concerns being addressed by designers. Increasingly, computer and storage services are delivered from the cloud\\u2014from shared facilities accessed over telecommunications networks.\", \"Computer software falls into two broad classes: system software and application software. The principal system software is the operating system. It manages the hardware, data and program files, and other system resources and provides means for the user to control the computer, generally via a graphical user interface (GUI). Application software is programs designed to handle specific tasks for users. Smartphone apps became a common way for individuals to access information systems. Other examples include general-purpose application suites with their spreadsheet and word-processing programs, as well as \\u201cvertical\\u201d applications that serve a specific industry segment\\u2014for instance, an application that schedules, routes, and tracks package deliveries for an overnight carrier. Larger firms use licensed applications developed and maintained by specialized software companies, customizing them to meet their specific needs, and develop other applications in-house or on an outsourced basis. Companies may also use applications delivered as software-as-a-service (SaaS) from the cloud over the Web. Proprietary software, available from and supported by its vendors, is being challenged by open-source software available on the Web for free use and modification under a license that protects its future availability.\", \"Telecommunications are used to connect, or network, computer systems and portable and wearable devices and to transmit information. Connections are established via wired or wireless media. Wired technologies include coaxial cable and fibre optics. Wireless technologies, predominantly based on the transmission of microwaves and radio waves, support mobile computing. Pervasive information systems have arisen with the computing devices embedded in many different physical objects. For example, sensors such as radio frequency identification devices (RFIDs) can be attached to products moving through the supply chain to enable the tracking of their location and the monitoring of their condition. Wireless sensor networks that are integrated into the Internet can produce massive amounts of data that can be used in seeking higher productivity or in monitoring the environment.\", \"Various computer network configurations are possible, depending on the needs of an organization. Local area networks (LANs) join computers at a particular site, such as an office building or an academic campus. Metropolitan area networks (MANs) cover a limited densely populated area and are the electronic infrastructure of \\u201csmart cities.\\u201d Wide area networks (WANs) connect widely distributed data centres, frequently run by different organizations. Peer-to-peer networks, without a centralized control, enable broad sharing of content. The Internet is a network of networks, connecting billions of computers located on every continent. Through networking, users gain access to information resources, such as large databases, and to other individuals, such as coworkers, clients, friends, or people who share their professional or private interests. Internet-type services can be provided within an organization and for its exclusive use by various intranets that are accessible through a browser; for example, an intranet may be deployed as an access portal to a shared corporate document base. To connect with business partners over the Internet in a private and secure manner, extranets are established as so-called virtual private networks (VPNs) by encrypting the messages.\", \"A massive \\u201cInternet of things\\u201d has emerged, as sensors and actuators have been widely distributed in the physical environment and are supplying data, such as acidity of a square yard of soil, the speed of a driving vehicle, or the blood pressure of an individual. The availability of such information enables a rapid reaction when necessary as well as sustained decision making based on processing of the massive accumulated data.\", \"Extensive networking infrastructure supports the growing move to cloud computing, with the information-system resources shared among multiple companies, leading to utilization efficiencies and freedom in localization of the data centres. Software-defined networking affords flexible control of telecommunications networks with algorithms that are responsive to real-time demands and resource availabilities.\", \"Many information systems are primarily delivery vehicles for data stored in databases. A database is a collection of interrelated data organized so that individual records or groups of records can be retrieved to satisfy various criteria. Typical examples of databases include employee records and product catalogs. Databases support the operations and management functions of an enterprise. Data warehouses contain the archival data, collected over time, that can be mined for information in order to develop and market new products, serve the existing customers better, or reach out to potential new customers. Anyone who has ever purchased something with a credit card\\u2014in person, by mail order, or over the Web\\u2014is included within such data collections.\", \"Massive collection and processing of the quantitative, or structured, data, as well as of the textual data often gathered on the Web, has developed into a broad initiative known as \\u201cbig data.\\u201d Many benefits can arise from decisions based on the facts reflected by big data. Examples include evidence-based medicine, economy of resources as a result of avoiding waste, and recommendations of new products (such as books or movies) based on a user\\u2019s interests. Big data enables innovative business models. For example, a commercial firm collects the prices of goods by crowdsourcing (collecting from numerous independent individuals) via smartphones around the world. The aggregated data supplies early information on price movements, enabling more responsive decision making than was previously possible.\", \"The processing of textual data\\u2014such as reviews and opinions articulated by individuals on social networks, blogs, and discussion boards\\u2014permits automated sentiment analysis for marketing, competitive intelligence, new product development, and other decision-making purposes.\", \"Qualified people are a vital component of any information system. Technical personnel include development and operations managers, business analysts, systems analysts and designers, database administrators, programmers, computer security specialists, and computer operators. In addition, all workers in an organization must be trained to utilize the capabilities of information systems as fully as possible. Billions of people around the world are learning about information systems as they use the Web.\", \"Procedures for using, operating, and maintaining an information system are part of its documentation. For example, procedures need to be established to run a payroll program, including when to run it, who is authorized to run it, and who has access to the output. In the autonomous computing initiative, data centres are increasingly run automatically, with the procedures embedded in the software that controls those centres.\", \"Information systems support operations, knowledge work, and management in organizations. (The overall structure of organizational information systems is shown in the figure.) Functional information systems that support a specific organizational function, such as marketing or production, have been supplanted in many cases by cross-functional systems built to support complete business processes, such as order processing or employee management. Such systems can be more effective in the development and delivery of the firm\\u2019s products and can be evaluated more closely with respect to the business outcomes. The information-system categories described here may be implemented with a great variety of application programs.\", \"\\u2026hieroglyphic script on papyrus, contained information about legal and economic transactions.

DSSs serve the management, operations and planning levels of an organization (usually mid and higher management) and help people make decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in advance\\u2014i.e. unstructured and semi-structured decision problems. Decision support systems can be either fully computerized or human-powered, or a combination of both.\", \"While academics have perceived DSS as a tool to support decision making process, DSS users see DSS as a tool to facilitate organizational processes.[1] Some authors have extended the definition of DSS to include any system that might support decision making and some DSS include a decision-making software component; Sprague (1980)[2] defines a properly termed DSS as follows:\", \"DSSs include knowledge-based systems. A properly designed DSS is an interactive software-based system intended to help decision makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data, documents, and personal knowledge, or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions.\", \"Typical information that a decision support application might gather and present includes:\", \"\", \"\", \"The concept of decision support has evolved mainly from the theoretical studies of organizational decision making done at the Carnegie Institute of Technology during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the implementation work done in the 1960s.[3] DSS became an area of research of its own in the middle of the 1970s, before gaining in intensity during the 1980s. In the middle and late 1980s, executive information systems (EIS), group decision support systems (GDSS), and organizational decision support systems (ODSS) evolved from the single user and model-oriented DSS.\", \"According to Sol (1987)[4] the definition and scope of DSS has been migrating over the years: in the 1970s DSS was described as \\\"a computer-based system to aid decision making\\\"; in the late 1970s the DSS movement started focusing on \\\"interactive computer-based systems which help decision-makers utilize data bases and models to solve ill-structured problems\\\"; in the 1980s DSS should provide systems \\\"using suitable and available technology to improve effectiveness of managerial and professional activities\\\", and towards the end of 1980s DSS faced a new challenge towards the design of intelligent workstations.[4]\", \"In 1987, Texas Instruments completed development of the Gate Assignment Display System (GADS) for United Airlines. This decision support system is credited with significantly reducing travel delays by aiding the management of ground operations at various airports, beginning with O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Stapleton Airport in Denver Colorado.[5] Beginning in about 1990, data warehousing and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) began broadening the realm of DSS. As the turn of the millennium approached, new Web-based analytical applications were introduced.\", \"The advent of more and better reporting technologies has seen DSS start to emerge as a critical component of management design. Examples of this can be seen in the intense amount of discussion of DSS in the education environment.\", \"DSS also have a weak connection to the user interface paradigm of hypertext. Both the University of Vermont PROMIS system (for medical decision making) and the Carnegie Mellon ZOG/KMS system (for military and business decision making) were decision support systems which also were major breakthroughs in user interface research. Furthermore, although hypertext researchers have generally been concerned with information overload, certain researchers, notably Douglas Engelbart, have been focused on decision makers in particular.\", \"Using the relationship with the user as the criterion, Haettenschwiler[6] differentiates passive, active, and cooperative DSS. A passive DSS is a system that aids the process of decision making, but that cannot bring out explicit decision suggestions or solutions. An active DSS can bring out such decision suggestions or solutions. A cooperative DSS allows for an iterative process between human and system towards the achievement of a consolidated solution: the decision maker (or its advisor) can modify, complete, or refine the decision suggestions provided by the system, before sending them back to the system for validation, and likewise the system again improves, completes, and refines the suggestions of the decision maker and sends them back to them for validation.\", \"Another taxonomy for DSS, according to the mode of assistance, has been created by Daniel Power: he differentiates communication-driven DSS, data-driven DSS, document-driven DSS, knowledge-driven DSS, and model-driven DSS.[7]\", \"Using scope as the criterion, Power[10] differentiates enterprise-wide DSS and desktop DSS. An enterprise-wide DSS is linked to large data warehouses and serves many managers in the company. A desktop, single-user DSS is a small system that runs on an individual manager's PC.\", \"Three fundamental components of a DSS architecture are:[6][7][11][12][13]\", \"The users themselves are also important components of the architecture.[6][13]\", \"Similarly to other systems, DSS systems require a structured approach. Such a framework includes people, technology, and the development approach.[11]\", \"The Early Framework of Decision Support System consists of four phases:\", \"DSS technology levels (of hardware and software) may include:\", \"An iterative developmental approach allows for the DSS to be changed and redesigned at various intervals. Once the system is designed, it will need to be tested and revised where necessary for the desired outcome.\", \"There are several ways to classify DSS applications. Not every DSS fits neatly into one of the categories, but may be a mix of two or more architectures.\", \"Holsapple and Whinston[14] classify DSS into the following six frameworks: text-oriented DSS, database-oriented DSS, spreadsheet-oriented DSS, solver-oriented DSS, rule-oriented DSS, and compound DSS. A compound DSS is the most popular classification for a DSS; it is a hybrid system that includes two or more of the five basic structures.[14]\", \"The support given by DSS can be separated into three distinct, interrelated categories:[15] Personal Support, Group Support, and Organizational Support.\", \"DSS components may be classified as:\", \"DSSs which perform selected cognitive decision-making functions and are based on artificial intelligence or intelligent agents technologies are called intelligent decision support systems (IDSS)[16]\", \"The nascent field of decision engineering treats the decision itself as an engineered object, and applies engineering principles such as design and quality assurance to an explicit representation of the elements that make up a decision.\", \"DSS can theoretically be built in any knowledge domain.\", \"One example is the clinical decision support system for medical diagnosis. There are four stages in the evolution of clinical decision support system (CDSS): the primitive version is standalone and does not support integration; the second generation supports integration with other medical systems; the third is standard-based, and the fourth is service model-based.[17]\", \"DSS is extensively used in business and management. Executive dashboard and other business performance software allow faster decision making, identification of negative trends, and better allocation of business resources. Due to DSS all the information from any organization is represented in the form of charts, graphs i.e. in a summarized way, which helps the management to take strategic decision. For example, one of the DSS applications is the management and development of complex anti-terrorism systems.[18] Other examples include a bank loan officer verifying the credit of a loan applicant or an engineering firm that has bids on several projects and wants to know if they can be competitive with their costs.\", \"A growing area of DSS application, concepts, principles, and techniques is in agricultural production, marketing for sustainable development. For example, the DSSAT4 package,[19][20] developed through financial support of USAID during the 80s and 90s, has allowed rapid assessment of several agricultural production systems around the world to facilitate decision-making at the farm and policy levels. Precision agriculture seeks to tailor decisions to particular portions of farm fields. There are, however, many constraints to the successful adoption on DSS in agriculture.[21]\", \"DSS are also prevalent in forest management where the long planning horizon and the spatial dimension of planning problems demands specific requirements. All aspects of Forest management, from log transportation, harvest scheduling to sustainability and ecosystem protection have been addressed by modern DSSs. In this context the consideration of single or multiple management objectives related to the provision of goods and services that traded or non-traded and often subject to resource constraints and decision problems. The Community of Practice of Forest Management Decision Support Systems provides a large repository on knowledge about the construction and use of forest Decision Support Systems.[22]\", \"A specific example concerns the Canadian National Railway system, which tests its equipment on a regular basis using a decision support system. A problem faced by any railroad is worn-out or defective rails, which can result in hundreds of derailments per year. Under a DSS, the Canadian National Railway system managed to decrease the incidence of derailments at the same time other companies were experiencing an increase.\"]}]", "chief programmer": "[{\"content\": [\"\", \"\\n            Cite this article \\n            \\n            Pick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.\\n            \\n        \", \"\\n                        \\n                        \\\"chief programmer team.\\\"\\n                        \\n                            A Dictionary of Computing.\\n                        .\\n                        \\n                        Encyclopedia.com.\\n                        20 Feb. 2018\\n                        <http://www.encyclopedia.com>.\\n                    \", \"\\n                        \\n                        \\\"chief programmer team.\\\" \\n                            A Dictionary of Computing.\\n                        \\n                        .

Another type of reasoning, inductive, is also used. Often, people confuse deductive reasoning with inductive reasoning, and vice versa. It is important to learn the meaning of each type of reasoning so that proper logic can be identified.\", \"\\r\\n\\tDeductive reasoning is a basic form of valid reasoning. Deductive reasoning, or deduction, starts out with a general statement, or hypothesis, and examines the possibilities to reach a specific, logical conclusion, according to California State University. The scientific method uses deduction to test hypotheses and theories. \\\"In deductive inference, we hold a theory and based on it we make a prediction of its consequences. That is, we predict what the observations should be if the theory were correct. We go from the general \\u2014 the theory \\u2014 to the specific \\u2014 the observations,\\\" said Dr. Sylvia Wassertheil-Smoller, a researcher and professor emerita at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\", \"\\r\\n\\tDeductive reasoning usually follows steps. First, there is a premise, then a second premise, and finally an inference. A common form of deductive reasoning is the syllogism, in which two statements \\u2014 a major premise and a minor premise \\u2014 reach a logical conclusion. For example, the premise \\\"Every A is B\\\" could be followed by another premise, \\\"This C is A.\\\" Those statements would lead to the conclusion \\\"This C is B.\\\" Syllogisms are considered a good way to test deductive reasoning to make sure the argument is valid.\", \"\\r\\n\\tFor example, \\\"All men are mortal. Harold is a man. Therefore, Harold is mortal.\\\" For deductive reasoning to be sound, the hypothesis must be correct. It is assumed that the premises, \\\"All men are mortal\\\" and \\\"Harold is a man\\\" are true. Therefore, the conclusion is logical and true. In deductive reasoning, if something is true of a class of things in general, it is also true for all members of that class.\\u00a0\", \"\\r\\n\\tAccording to California State University, deductive inference conclusions are certain provided the premises are true. It's possible to come to a logical conclusion even if the generalization is not true. If the generalization is wrong, the conclusion may be logical, but it may also be untrue. For example, the argument, \\\"All bald men are grandfathers. Harold is bald. Therefore, Harold is a grandfather,\\\" is valid logically but it is untrue because the original statement is false.\", \"\\r\\n\\tInductive reasoning is the opposite of deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning makes broad generalizations from specific observations. Basically, there is data, then conclusions are drawn from the data. This is called inductive logic, according to Utah State University.\\u00a0\", \"\\r\\n\\t\\\"In inductive inference, we go from the specific to the general. We make many observations, discern a pattern, make a generalization, and infer an explanation or a theory,\\\" Wassertheil-Smoller told Live Science. \\\"In science, there is a constant interplay between inductive inference (based on observations) and deductive inference (based on theory), until we get closer and closer to the 'truth,' which we can only approach but not ascertain with complete certainty.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\r\\n\\tAn example of inductive logic is, \\\"The coin I pulled from the bag is a penny. That coin is a penny. A third coin from the bag is a penny. Therefore, all the coins in the bag are pennies.\\\"\", \"\\r\\n\\tEven if all of the premises are true in a statement, inductive reasoning allows for the conclusion to be false. Here's an example: \\\"Harold is a grandfather. Harold is bald. Therefore, all grandfathers are bald.\\\" The conclusion does not follow logically from the statements.\", \"\\r\\n\\tInductive reasoning has its place in the scientific method. Scientists use it to form hypotheses and theories. Deductive reasoning allows them to apply the theories to specific situations.\", \"\\r\\n\\tAnother form of scientific reasoning that doesn't fit in with inductive or deductive reasoning is abductive. Abductive reasoning usually starts with an incomplete set of observations and proceeds to the likeliest possible explanation for the group of observations, according to Butte College. It is based on making and testing hypotheses using the best information available. It often entails making an educated guess after observing a phenomenon for which there is no clear explanation.\\u00a0\", \"\\r\\n\\tFor example, a person walks into their living room and finds torn up papers all over the floor. The person's dog has been alone in the room all day. The person concludes that the dog tore up the papers because it is the most likely scenario. Now, the person's sister may have brought by his niece and she may have torn up the papers, or it may have been done by the landlord, but the dog theory is the more likely conclusion.\", \"\\r\\n\\tAbductive reasoning is useful for forming hypotheses to be tested.

One example of such properties would be the actual form of procedure calls and successes which occur during computations of a program. They are often used by programmers in their informal reasoning. In this paper, the inductive assertion method for proving partial correctness of logic programs is introduced and proved sound. The method makes it possible to formulate and prove properties which are inexpressible in terms of the declarative semantics. An execution mechanism using the Prolog computation rule and arbitrary search strategy (e.g., OR-parallelism or Prolog backtracking) is assumed. The method may also be used to specify the semantics of some extra-logical built-in procedures for which the declarative semantics is not applicable.\", \"This research has been partially supported by the National Swedish Board for Technical Development, Project No. STUF 85-3166, STU 86-3372 and STU 87-2926.

{\"content\": [\" \\n \\nAn inductive logic is a system of evidential support that extends\\ndeductive logic to less-than-certain inferences. For valid deductive\\narguments the premises logically entail the conclusion, where\\nthe entailment means that the truth of the premises provides a\\nguarantee of the truth of the conclusion. Similarly, in a \\ngood inductive argument the premises should provide some degree of \\nsupport for the conclusion, where such support means that the \\ntruth of the premises indicates with some degree of strength \\nthat the conclusion is true. Presumably, if the logic of good \\ninductive arguments is to be of any real value, the measure of support \\nit articulates should meet the following condition: \", \" \\n \\nThis article will focus on the kind of the approach to \\ninductive logic most widely studied by philosophers and logicians in \\nrecent years. These logics employ conditional probability functions to  \\nrepresent measures of the degree to which evidence \\nstatements support hypotheses. This kind of approach usually draws on \\nBayes' theorem, which is a theorem of probability theory, to \\narticulate how the implications of hypotheses about evidence \\nclaims influences the degree to which hypotheses are supported  \\nby those evidence claims. We will examine the extent to which this  \\nkind of logic may pass muster as \\nan adequate logic of evidential support, especially in regard to the \\ntesting of scientific hypotheses. In particular, we will see how such a \\nlogic may be shown to satisfy the Criterion of Adequacy.\", \"Sections 1 through 3 present all of the main ideas behind the probabilistic \\nlogic of evidential support. For most readers these three sections will suffice to \\nprovide an adequate understanding of the subject. Those readers who want to know \\nmore about how the logic applies when the implications of hypotheses about evidence \\nclaims (called likelihoods) are vague or imprecise may, after reading \\nsections 1-3, skip down to section 6.\", \"Sections 4 and 5 are for the more advanced reader who wants a detailed  \\nunderstanding of some telling results about how this logic may bring   \\nabout convergence to the truth. These results show that the Criterion of   \\nAdequacy is indeed satisfied\\u2014that as evidence accumulates, false \\nhypotheses will very probably come to have evidential support values (as measured \\nby their posterior probabilities) that approach 0; and as this happens, \\na true hypothesis will very probably acquire evidential support values (as measured \\nby their posterior probabilities) that approach 1.\", \" \\n Let us begin by considering  examples of the kinds of arguments \\nan inductive logic should explicate. Consider the following two \\narguments:\", \" \\n Example 2. 62 percent of voters in a random sample \\nof 400 registered voters (polled on February 20, 2004) said that they \\nfavor John Kerry over George W. Bush for President in the 2004 \\nPresidential election. This supports with a probability of at least \\n.95 the hypothesis that between 57 percent and 67 percent of all \\nregistered voters favor Kerry over Bush for President (at or around \\nthe time the poll was taken).\", \" \\n An argument of this kind is often called an induction by \\nenumeration of cases. We may represent the logical form of such \\narguments semi-formally as follows:\", \" \\n  Therefore, with degree of support p,\", \" \\n Conclusion: The proportion of all members of B that have \\nattribute A is between r\\u2212q and \\nr+q (i.e., is within margin of error \\nq of r).\", \" \\n \\nLet's lay out this argument more formally. The Premise breaks down into  \\nthree separate  \\n premises:[1]\", \" \\n Any inductive logic that encompasses such arguments should address \\ntwo challenges.  (1) It should tell us which enumerative inductive \\narguments should count as good inductive arguments rather \\nthan as inductive fallacies. In particular, it should tell us how to \\ndetermine the appropriate degree p to which such \\npremises inductively support the conclusion, for a given \\nmargin of error q. (2) It should demonstrably satisfy the \\nCoA. That is, it should be provable (as a metatheorem) that \\nif a conclusion expressing the approximate proportion for an \\nattribute in a population is true, then it is very likely \\nthat sufficiently numerous random samples of the population will \\nprovide true premises for good inductive arguments that \\nconfer degrees of support p approaching 1 for that \\ntrue conclusion\\u2014where, on pain of triviality, these \\nsufficiently numerous samples are only a tiny fraction of a \\nlarge population. Later we will see how a probabilistic inductive \\nlogic may meet these two challenges.\", \" \\n Enumerative induction is rather limited in scope. This form of \\ninduction is only applicable to the support of claims involving simple \\nuniversal conditionals (i.e., claims of form \\u2018All Bs \\nare As\\u2019) and claims about the proportion of an attribute \\nin a population (i.e., \\u2018The frequency of As among the \\nBs is r\\u2019). And it applies only when the evidence for \\nsuch claims consists of instances of Bs observed to be either \\nAs or non-As. However, many important empirical \\nhypotheses are not reducible to this simple form, and the evidence for \\nhypotheses is often not composed of simple instances. Consider, for \\nexample, the Newtonian Theory of Mechanics:\", \" \\n The evidence for (and against) this theory is not gotten by examining \\na randomly selected subset of objects and the forces acting upon \\nthem. Rather, the theory is tested by calculating observable phenomena \\nentailed by it in a wide variety of specific situations\\u2014ranging \\nfrom simple collisions between small bodies to the trajectories of \\nplanets and comets\\u2014and then seeing whether those phenomena \\nreally occur. This approach to testing hypotheses and theories is \\nubiquitous, and should be captured by an adequate inductive logic.\", \" \\n Many less theoretical instances of inductive reasoning also fail to \\nbe captured by enumerative induction. Consider the kinds of inferences \\nmembers of a jury are supposed to make based on the evidence presented \\nat a murder trial. The inference to probable guilt or innocence is \\nusually based on a patchwork of various sorts of evidence. It almost \\nnever involves consideration of a randomly selected sequences of past \\nsituations when people like the accused committed similar murders. Or, \\nconsider how a doctor diagnoses her patient on the basis of his \\nsymptoms. Although the frequency of occurrence of various diseases \\nwhen similar symptoms were present may play a role, this is clearly \\nnot the whole story. Diagnosticians commonly employ a form of \\nhypothetical reasoning\\u2014e.g., if the patient has a \\nbrain tumor, would that account for all of his symptoms?; or are these \\nsymptoms more likely the result of a minor stroke?; or is there \\nanother possible cause? The point is that a full account of inductive \\nlogic should not be limited to enumerative induction, but should also \\nexplicate the logic of hypothetical reasoning through which \\nhypotheses and theories are tested on the basis of their predictions \\nabout specific observations. In Section 3 we will see how a kind of\\nprobabilistic inductive logic called \\\"Bayesian Confirmation Theory\\\" captures such reasoning.\", \" \\n Probability, and the equivalent notion odds, are \\nthe oldest and best understood ways of representing partial belief and \\nuncertain inference.  Probability has been studied by mathematicians \\nfor over 350 years, but the concept is certainly much older. In recent \\ntimes a number of other related representations of uncertainty have \\nemerged. Many of these have found useful application in computer based \\nartificial intelligence systems that perform inductive inferences in \\nexpert domains such as medical diagnosis. This article will explicate \\nthe representation of inductive inferences in terms of \\nprobability. A brief comparative description of some of the \\nmost prominent alternative representations may be found in the \\nfollowing supplementary document:\", \" The mathematical study of probability originated with Blaise\\n Pascal and Pierre de Fermat in the mid-17th century. From\\n that time through the early 19th century, as the\\n mathematical theory continued to develop, the theory was primarily\\n applied to the assessment of risk in games of chance and to drawing\\n simple statistical inferences about characteristics of large\\n populations\\u2014e.g., to compute appropriate life insurance\\n premiums based on mortality rates. In the early 19th\\n century Pierre de Laplace made further theoretical advances and\\n showed how to apply probabilistic reasoning to a much wider range of\\n scientific and practical problems. Since that time probability has\\n become an indispensable tool in the sciences, business, and many\\n other areas of modern life.\", \" \\n Throughout its development various researchers appear to have thought \\nof probability as a kind of logic. But the first extended treatment of \\nprobability as an explicit part of logic was George Boole's The \\nLaws of Thought (1854). John Venn followed two decades later with \\nan alternative empirical frequentist account of probability in The Logic of \\nChance (1876). Not long after that the whole discipline of logic \\nwas transformed by new developments in deductive logic.\", \" \\n In the late 19th and early 20th century Frege, \\nfollowed by Russell and Whitehead, showed how deductive logic could be \\nrepresented in the kind of rigorous formal system we now call \\nquantificational logic or predicate logic. For the \\nfirst time logicians had a fully formal deductive logic powerful \\nenough to represent all valid deductive arguments in mathematics and \\nthe sciences\\u2014a logic in which the validity of deductive \\narguments depends only on the logical structure of the sentences \\ninvolved. This development spurred some logicians to attempt to apply \\na similar approach to inductive reasoning. The idea was to extend the \\ndeductive entailment relation to a notion of probabilistic \\nentailment for cases where premises provide less than conclusive \\nsupport for conclusions. These partial entailments are \\nexpressed in terms of conditional probabilities, \\nprobabilities of the form  \\n P[C | B] \\n = r (read \\u201cthe probability of C given \\nB is r\\u201d), where P is a probability \\nfunction, C is a conclusion sentence, B is a \\nconjunction of premise sentences, and r is the probabilistic degree of \\nsupport that B provides for C. Attempts to develop \\nsuch a logic have varied widely in regard to precisely how the \\ndeductive model is emulated.\", \" Some inductive logicians have tried to follow the deductive\\n paradigm very closely by attempting to specify inductive support\\n probabilities in terms of the syntactic structures of premise and\\n conclusion sentences. In deductive logic the syntactic structure of\\n the sentences involved completely determines whether premises\\n logically entail a conclusion. So these logicians attempted to\\n specify inductive support probabilities solely in terms of the\\n syntactic structure of premise and conclusion sentences. In such a\\n system each sentence confers a syntactically specified degree of\\n support on each of the other sentences of the language.  The\\n inductive probabilities in such a system are logical in the\\n sense that they depend on syntactic structure alone.  This kind of\\n conception was articulated to some extent by John Maynard Keynes in\\n his Treatise on Probability (1921). Rudolf Carnap pursued\\n this idea with greater rigor in his Logical Foundations of\\n Probability (1950) and in several subsequent works (e.g., Carnap\\n 1952). (For details of Carnap's approach see the section on\\n logical probability \\n  in the entry on  \\n interpretations of the probability calculus, \\n in this Encyclopedia.)\", \" \\n In the inductive logics of Keynes and Carnap, Bayes' theorem, which \\nis a theorem of probability theory, plays a central role in expressing \\nhow evidence comes to bear on hypotheses. (We'll examine Bayes' \\ntheorem later.) So, such approaches might well be called Bayesian \\nlogicist inductive logics. Other well-known Bayesian logicist \\nattempts to develop a probabilistic inductive logic include Jeffreys\\n1939, Jaynes 1968, and Rosenkrantz 1981.\", \" \\n It is now generally held that the core idea of Bayesian logicism is \\nfatally flawed\\u2014that syntactic logical structure cannot be the \\nsole determiner of the degree to which premises inductively support \\nconclusions. A crucial facet of the problem faced by Bayesian logicism \\ninvolves how the logic is supposed to apply to scientific contexts \\nwhere the conclusion sentence is some hypothesis or theory, and the \\npremises are evidence claims.  The difficulty is that in any \\nprobabilistic logic that satisfies the usual axioms for probabilities, \\nthe inductive support for a hypothesis must depend in part on its \\nprior probability. This prior probability represents\\nhow plausible the hypothesis is supposed to be based on considerations\\nother than the observational and experimental evidence (e.g., perhaps\\ndue to relevant plausibility arguments). A Bayesian logicist must tell\\nus how to assign values to these pre-evidential prior\\nprobabilities of hypotheses, for each of the hypotheses or\\ntheories under consideration. Furthermore, this kind of Bayesian\\nlogicist must determine these prior probability values in a\\nway that relies only on the syntactic logical structure of these\\nhypotheses, perhaps based on some measure of their syntactic\\nsimplicities. There are severe technical problems with getting this\\nidea to work. Moreover, various kinds of examples seem to show that\\nsuch an approach must assign intuitively quite unreasonable prior\\nprobabilities to hypotheses in specific cases (see the footnote cited\\nnear the end of section 3.2 for details).  Furthermore, for this idea\\nto apply to the evidential support of real scientific theories,\\nscientists would have to formalize theories in a way that makes their\\nrelevant syntactic structures apparent, and then evaluate theories\\nsolely on that syntactic basis (together with their syntactic\\nrelationships to evidence statements). Are we to evaluate alternative\\ntheories of gravitation (and alternative quantum theories) this way?\\nThis seems an extremely doubtful approach to the evaluation of real\\nscientific theories and hypotheses.  Thus, it seems that logical\\nstructure alone cannot suffice for the inductive evaluation of\\nscientific hypotheses. (This issue will be treated in more detail in\\nSection 3, after we first see how probabilistic logics employ Bayes'\\ntheorem to represent the evidential support for hypotheses as a\\nfunction of prior probabilities together with\\ntheir evidential likelihoods.)\", \" \\n At about the time the Bayesian logicist idea was developing, an \\nalternative conception of probabilistic inductive reasoning was also \\nemerging. This approach is now generally referred to as the Bayesian \\nsubjectivist or personalist approach to inductive\\nreasoning (see, e.g., Ramsey 1926; De Finetti 1937; Savage 1954;\\nEdwards, Lindman, & Savage 1963; Jeffrey 1983, 1992; Howson &\\nUrbach 1993; Joyce 1999). It treats inductive probability as part of a\\nlarger normative theory of belief and action known as Bayesian\\ndecision theory. The principal idea is that the strength of an\\nagent's desires for various possible outcomes should combine with her\\nbelief-strengths regarding claims about the world to produce optimally\\nrational decisions. Bayesian subjectivists provide a logic that\\ncaptures this idea, and they attempt to justify this logic by showing\\nthat in principle it leads to optimal decisions about which of various\\nrisky alternatives should be pursued. On the Bayesian subjectivist or\\npersonalist account of inductive probability, inductive probability\\nfunctions represent the subjective (or personal) belief-strengths of\\nideally rational agents, the kind of belief strengths that figure into\\nrational decision making. (See the section on\\n subjective probability \\n in the entry on \\n interpretations of the probability calculus, \\n in this Encyclopedia.)\", \" Elements of the logicist conception of inductive logic live on\\ntoday as part of the general approach called Bayesian inductive\\nlogic.  However, among philosophers and statisticians the term\\n\\u2018Bayesian\\u2019 is now most closely associated with the\\nsubjectivist or personalist account of belief and decision. And the\\nterm \\u2018Bayesian inductive logic\\u2019 has come to carry the\\nconnotation of a logic that involves purely subjective\\nprobabilities. This current usage is misleading since for inductive\\nlogics the Bayesian/non-Bayesian distinction should really hang on\\nwhether the logic gives Bayes' theorem a prominent role, or whether\\nthe logic largely eschews the use of Bayes' theorem in inductive\\ninferences (as do the classical approaches to statistical\\ninference developed by R. A. Fisher (1922) and by Neyman and Pearson\\n(1967)).  Indeed, any inductive logic that employs the same\\nprobability functions to represent both the probabilities of\\nevidence claims due to hypotheses and the probabilities of\\nhypotheses due to those evidence claims must be\\na Bayesian inductive logic in this broader sense; because\\nBayes' theorem follows directly from the axioms that each probability\\nfunction must satisfy, and Bayes' theorem expresses a necessary\\nconnection between the probabilities of evidence claims due to\\nhypotheses and the probabilities of hypotheses due to those\\nevidence claims.\", \" \\n In this article the probabilistic inductive logic we will \\nexamine is a Bayesian inductive logic in the broader sense. \\nThis logic will not presuppose the subjectivist Bayesian \\ntheory of belief and decision, and will avoid the objectionable \\nfeatures of Bayesian logicism. Later we will see that there are good reasons \\nto distinguish inductive probabilities from Bayesian \\ndegree-of-belief probabilities and from purely \\nlogical probabilities. So, the probabilistic logic articulated in \\nthis article will be presented in a way that depends on neither of these \\nconceptions of what the probability functions are. However, this version of \\nthe logic will be general enough that it may be fitted to a  \\nBayesian subjectivist or Bayesian logicist program, if \\none desires to do that.\", \" All logics derive from the meanings of terms in sentences. What we\\nnow recognize as formal deductive logic rests on the meanings\\n(i.e., the truth-functional properties) of the standard logical\\nterms. These terms, and the symbols we will employ to represent them,\\nare as follows: \\u2018not\\u2019, \\u2018~\\u2019; \\u2018and\\u2019,\\n\\u2018\\u00b7\\u2019; \\u2018or\\u2019, \\u2018\\u2228\\u2019;\\ntruth-functional \\u2018if-then\\u2019, \\u2018\\u2283\\u2019; \\u2018if\\nand only if\\u2019, \\u2018\\u2261\\u2019; the quantifiers\\n\\u2018all\\u2019, \\u2018\\u2200\\u2019, and \\u2018some\\u2019,\\n\\u2018\\u2203\\u2019; and the identity relation, \\u2018=\\u2019.\\nThe meanings of all other terms (i.e., names, and predicate and\\nrelational expressions) are permitted to \\u201cfloat\\nfree\\u201d. That is, the logic depends neither on their meanings nor\\non the truth-values of sentences containing them. It merely supposes\\nthat these other terms are meaningful, and that sentences containing\\nthem have truth-values. Deductive logic then tells us that the logical\\nstructures of some sentences\\u2014i.e., the syntactic arrangements of\\ntheir logical terms\\u2014preclude them from being jointly true of any\\npossible state of affairs. That is the notion of\\nlogical inconsistency. The notion of logical \\nentailment is interdefinable with it. A collection of premise \\nsentences logically entails a conclusion sentence just when \\nthe negation of the conclusion is logically inconsistent with \\nthose premises.\", \"\\nAn inductive logic must, it seems, deviate from this paradigm in \\nseveral significant ways. For one thing, logical entailment is an \\nabsolute, all-or-nothing relationship between sentences, whereas \\ninductive support comes in degrees of strength. For another, although \\nthe notion of inductive support is analogous to the deductive \\nnotion of logical entailment, and is arguably an extension of \\nit, there seems to be no inductive logic extension of the notion of \\nlogical inconsistency\\u2014at least none that is \\ninter-definable with inductive support in the way that \\nlogical inconsistency is inter-definable with logical \\nentailment. That is, B logically entails A just \\nwhen (B\\u00b7~A) is logically \\ninconsistent. However, it turns out that when the unconditional \\nprobability of (B\\u00b7~A) is very nearly 0 (i.e., \\nwhen (B\\u00b7~A) is \\u201cnearly \\ninconsistent\\u201d), the degree to which B inductively \\nsupports A,  \\n P[A | B],  \\n may range anywhere between 0 and 1. \", \"\\nAnother notable difference is that when B logically \\nentails A, adding a premise C cannot undermine \\nthe entailment\\u2014i.e., (C\\u00b7B) must entail \\nA as well. This property of logical entailment is \\ncalled monotonicity.  But inductive support is \\nnonmonotonic. In general, depending on\\nwhat A, B, and C mean, adding a\\npremise C to B may substantially raise the degree of\\nsupport for A, or may substantially lower it, or may leave it\\ncompletely unchanged\\u2014i.e.,\\n P[A | C\\u00b7B]  \\n may have a value much larger than  \\n P[A | B],  \\n or a much smaller value, or it may have the same, or nearly the same value as \\nP[A | B].\", \"\\nIn a formal treatment of probabilistic inductive logic, inductive\\nsupport is represented by conditional probability functions defined on\\nsentences of a formal language L. These conditional\\nprobability functions are constrained by certain rules or axioms that\\nare sensitive to the meanings of the logical terms (i.e.,\\n\\u2018not\\u2019, \\u2018and\\u2019, \\u2018or\\u2019, etc., the\\nquantifiers \\u2018all\\u2019 and \\u2018some\\u2019, and the identity\\nrelation). The axioms apply without regard for what the other terms of\\nthe language may mean. In essence the axioms specify a family\\nof possible support functions,\\n{P\\u03b2,\\nP\\u03b3, \\u2026 , P\\u03b4, \\n\\u2026} for a given language L. Although each support \\nfunction satisfies these same axioms, the further issue of which among \\nthem provides an appropriate measure of inductive support is \\nnot settled by the axioms alone. That may depend on additional \\nfactors, such as the meanings of the non-logical terms in the \\nlanguage.\", \"\\nA good way to specify the rules or axioms of the logic of inductive\\nsupport functions is as follows.

It comports with the idea that an inductive \\n  support function is a generalization of the deductive \\n  entailment relation.\", \"\\nRule (3) is equally obvious. It says that whenever B is logically \\nequivalent to C, as premises each must provide precisely the same \\namount of support to every conclusion.\", \"\\nRule (4) says that inductive support \\u201cadds up\\u201d in a \\nplausible way. When C logically entails the incompatibility \\nof A and B, the support C provides each \\nseparately must sum to the support it provides for their disjunction. \\nThe only exception is in cases where C acts like a \\ncontradiction and supports all sentences to degree 1.\", \"\\nTo understand what Rule (5) says, think of a support function \\nP\\u03b1 as describing a measure on possible worlds or \\npossible states of affairs. \\n \\u2018P\\u03b1[C | D] \\n = r\\u2019 says that the proportion of \\nworlds in which C is true among those where D is \\ntrue is r.

One is this:\", \"\\nThe idea is that inductive logic is about evidential support for \\ncontingent claims. Nothing can count as empirical evidence against \\nnon-contingent truths.  They should be maximally \\nsupported by all claims C.\", \"\\nOne important respect in which inductive logic should follow the \\ndeductive paradigm is in not presupposing the truth-values of \\ncontingent sentences.  No inductive support \\nfunction P\\u03b1 should permit a tautological premise to assign \\ndegree of support 1 to a contingent claim\\u2014i.e., \\n P\\u03b1[C | (B \\u2228~B)] \\n should always be less than 1 when C is contingent. For, the whole \\nidea of inductive logic is to provide a measure of the extent to which \\ncontingent premise sentences indicate the likely truth-values of \\ncontingent conclusion sentences. This idea won't work \\nproperly if the truth-values of some contingent sentences are \\npresupposed. Such presuppositions would make inductive logic \\nenthymematic. It may hide significant premises in inductive support \\nrelationships.\", \"\\nHowever, it is common practice for probabilistic logicians to sweep \\nprovisionally accepted contingent claims under the rug by assigning \\nthem probability 1. This saves the trouble of repeatedly writing a \\ngiven contingent sentence B as a premise, since  \\n P\\u03b3[A | \\nB\\u00b7C]  \\n will just equal  \\n P\\u03b3[A | C]  \\n whenever  \\n  P\\u03b3[B | C] \\n = 1. Although this device is useful, such probability functions should be \\nconsidered mere abbreviations of proper, logically explicit, \\nnon-enthymematic, inductive support functions. Thus, properly \\nspeaking, an inductive support function P\\u03b1 \\nshould not assign probability 1 to a sentence relative to all \\npossible premises unless that sentence is either (i) logically \\ntrue, or (ii) an axiom of set theory or some other piece of pure \\nmathematics employed by the sciences, or (iii) unless according to the \\ninterpretation of the language that P\\u03b1 \\npresupposes, the sentence is analytic, and so outside the \\nrealm of evidential support. Thus, we adopt the following version of \\nthe so-called \\u201caxiom of regularity\\u201d.\", \"\\nThis is more a convention than an axiom. Taken together with (6) it \\ntells us that a support function P\\u03b1 counts \\nas non-contingently true just those sentences that it assigns \\nprobability 1 on every premise.\", \"\\nSome Bayesian logicists (e.g., Carnap) thought that inductive \\nlogic might be made to depend solely on the logical form of sentences, \\njust like deductive logic. The idea was, effectively, to supplement \\naxioms 1\\u20137 with additional axioms that depend only on the logical \\nstructures of sentences, and to introduce enough such axioms to \\nreduce the number of possible support functions to a single uniquely best \\nconfirmation function. It is now widely agreed that this project cannot be carried \\nout in a plausible way. Perhaps there are additional rules that should \\nbe added to 1\\u20137. But it is doubtful such rules can suffice to specify \\na single, uniquely qualified support function based only on logical \\nstructure. We will see why in Section 3, but only after first seeing how inductive \\nprobabilities capture the relationship between hypotheses and \\nevidence.\", \"\\nAxioms 1\\u20137 for conditional probability functions merely place formal \\nconstraints on what may properly count as a degree of support \\nfunction.  Each function P\\u03b1 satisfying \\nthese rules may be viewed as a possible way of applying the notion of \\ninductive support to a language L that respects the \\nmeanings of the logical terms, much as each possible truth-value \\nassignment for a language represents a possible way of assigning \\ntruth-values to its sentences in a way that respects the semantic \\nrules expressing the meanings of the logical terms. The issue of which \\nof the possible truth-value assignments to a language \\nrepresents the actual truth or falsehood of its sentences \\ndepends on more than this\\u2014it depends on the meanings of the \\nnon-logical terms and on the state of the actual world.  Similarly, \\nthe degree to which some sentences actually support others in \\na fully meaningful language must rely on something more than merely \\nsatisfying the axioms for support functions. It must, at least, rely \\non what the sentences of the language mean, and perhaps on much more \\nbesides. But, what more? Various \\u201cinterpretations of \\nprobability\\u201d, which offer accounts of how support functions are \\nto be understood, may help by filling out our conception of what \\ninductive support is really about. There are two prominent \\nviews.\", \"\\nOne reading is to take each P\\u03b1 as a measure on \\npossible worlds, or possible states of affairs. The idea is that, \\ngiven a fully meaningful language (and, perhaps relative to the \\ninferential inclinations of a particular agent, \\u03b1)  \\n  \\u2018P\\u03b1[A | B] \\n = r\\u2019 says that among the worlds in which B is \\ntrue, A is true in proportion r of them. There will \\ngenerally not be a single privileged way to define such a measure on \\npossible worlds. Rather, it may be that each of a number of functions \\nP\\u03b1, P\\u03b2, \\nP\\u03b3, \\u2026, etc., satisfying the \\nconstraints imposed by axioms 1-7 can represent a viable measure of \\nthe inferential import of propositions expressed by sentences \\nof the language. This idea needs more fleshing out, of course. The \\nnext section will give some indication of how that might go.\", \"\\nSubjectivist Bayesians offer an alternative reading of the \\nsupport functions.  First, they usually take unconditional probability \\nas basic, and they take conditional probabilities as defined in terms \\nof them: the conditional probability  \\n  \\n \\u2018P\\u03b1[A | \\nB]\\u2019  \\n is defined as a ratio of unconditional probabilities,  \\n  P\\u03b1[A\\u00b7B]/P\\u03b1[B].  \\n  Subjectivist Bayesians take each unconditional probability \\nfunction P\\u03b1 to represent the \\nbelief-strengths or confidence-strengths of an ideally rational agent, \\n\\u03b1. On this \\n understanding \\u2018P\\u03b1[A] \\n =r\\u2019 says, \\u201cthe strength of \\u03b1's belief (or \\nconfidence) that A is truth is r\\u201d. \\nSubjectivist Bayesians usually tie such belief strengths to what the \\nagent would be willing to bet on A turning out to be true. \\nRoughly, the idea is this. Suppose that an ideally rational agent \\n\\u03b1 would be willing to accept a wager that would yield (no less \\nthan) $u if A turns out to be true and would lose \\nhim $1 if A turns out to be false. Then, under reasonable \\nassumptions about how much he desires money, it can be shown that his \\nbelief strength that A is true should be \\n P\\u03b1[A] \\n = 1/(u+1).  And it can further be shown that any function \\nP\\u03b1 that expresses such betting-related \\nbelief-strengths on all statements in agent \\u03b1's language must \\nsatisfy axioms for unconditional probabilities analogous to axioms \\n1\\u20135. \\n [4] \\n Moreover, it can be shown that any function P\\u03b2 that \\nsatisfies these axioms is a possible rational belief function for some \\nideally rational agent \\u03b2. These relationships between \\nbelief-strengths and the desirability of outcomes (e.g., gaining money \\nor goods on bets) are at the core of subjectivist Bayesian \\ndecision theory.  Subjectivist Bayesians usually take \\ninductive probability to just be this notion of \\nprobabilistic belief-strength.\", \"\\nUndoubtedly real agents do believe some claims more strongly than \\nothers. And, arguably, the belief strengths of real agents can be \\nmeasured on a probabilistic scale between 0 and 1, at least \\napproximately. And clearly the inductive support of evidence for \\nhypotheses should influence the strength of an agent's belief in those \\nhypotheses. However, there is good reason for caution about viewing \\ninductive support functions as Bayesian belief-strength \\nfunctions, as we will see a bit later. So, perhaps an agent's support \\nfunction is not simply identical to his belief function, and \\nperhaps the relationship between inductive support and \\nbelief-strength is somewhat more complicated.\", \"\\nIn any case, some account of what support functions are supposed to \\nrepresent is clearly needed. The belief function account and the \\npossible worlds account are two attempts to provide this. Let us put \\nthis interpretative issue aside for now. One may be able to get a \\nbetter handle on what inductive support functions really are \\nafter one sees how the inductive logic that draws on them is supposed \\nto work.\", \"\\nOne of the most important applications of a formal inductive logic is \\nto the confirmation or refutation of scientific hypotheses.

We'll now look into how support functions (a.k.a. confirmation functions) \\nrepresent the logic of hypothesis confirmation.

This hypothesis, h, together with background b \\nabout decay products and the efficiency of the equipment used to \\ndetect them (which may itself be an auxiliary statistical hypothesis), \\nyields precisely calculable values for likelihoods  \\nP[ek | \\nh\\u00b7b\\u00b7c] of possible outcomes \\nof the experimental arrangement.\", \"\\nLikelihoods that arise from explicit statistical claims\\u2014either within the hypotheses being tested, or from explicit \\nstatistical background claims that tie the hypotheses to the evidence\\u2014are often called direct inference likelihoods. Such \\nlikelihoods are completely objective. So it seems reasonable to \\nsuppose that all support functions should agree on their values, just \\nas all support functions agree on likelihoods when evidence is \\nlogically entailed. Direct inference likelihoods are logical  \\nin an extended, non-deductive sense. Indeed, some logicians have \\nattempted to spell out the logic of direct inferences in \\nterms of the logical form of the sentences \\n involved.[6]  \\n But regardless of whether that project succeeds, it seems reasonable \\nto take likelihoods of this sort to have highly objective or \\nintersubjectively agreed values.\", \"\\nNot all likelihoods of interest in confirmational contexts are \\nwarranted deductively or by explicitly stated statistical \\nclaims. Nevertheless, the likelihoods that relate hypotheses to \\nevidence in scientific contexts should often have objective or \\nintersubjectively agreed values. So, although a variety of different \\nsupport functions P\\u03b1,  \\nP\\u03b2 ,\\u2026, P\\u03b3, \\netc., may be needed to represent the differing \\u201cinductive \\nproclivities\\u201d of the various members of a scientific community, \\nall should agree, at least approximately, on the values of the \\nlikelihoods.  For, likelihoods represent the empirical content of a \\nhypothesis, what the hypothesis (together with background b)  \\nprobabilistically implies about the evidence. Thus, the \\nempirical objectivity of a science relies on a high degree of \\nobjectivity or intersubjective agreement among scientists on the \\nnumerical values of likelihoods.\", \"\\nTo see the point more vividly, imagine what a science would be like \\nif scientists disagreed widely about the values of likelihoods. Each \\npractitioner interprets a theory to say quite different \\nthings about how likely it is that various possible evidence statements will \\nturn out to be true. Whereas scientist \\u03b1 takes theory  \\nh1 to probabilistically imply that event  \\ne is highly likely, his colleague \\u03b2 understands the \\nempirical import of h1 to say that e is \\nvery unlikely. And, conversely, \\u03b1 takes competing theory  \\nh2 to probabilistically imply that e is \\nquite unlikely, whereas \\u03b2 reads h2 to say \\nthat e is very likely. So, for \\u03b1 the evidential outcome \\ne supplies strong support for h1 over  \\nh2, because \\n P\\u03b1[e | \\nh1\\u00b7b\\u00b7c] \\n \\u00a0 \\n  >>  \\n  P\\u03b1[e | \\n    h2\\u00b7b\\u00b7c]. But his colleague \\u03b2 takes outcome e to show just the \\n  opposite\\u2014that h2 is strongly supported \\n  over h1\\u2014because P\\u03b2[e | \\n    h1\\u00b7b\\u00b7c] << P\\u03b2[e \\n     | h2\\u00b7b\\u00b7c].  \\n  If this kind of thing were to occur often or for significant evidence \\n  claims in a scientific domain, it would make a shambles of the \\n  empirical objectivity of that science. It would completely undermine \\n  the empirical testability of its hypotheses and theories. Under such \\n  circumstances, although each scientist employs the same \\n  theoretical sentences to express a given theory h,  \\n  each understands the empirical import of these sentences so \\n  differently that h as understood by \\u03b1 is an empirically \\n  different theory than h as understood by \\u03b2. Thus, the \\n  empirical objectivity of the sciences requires that experts should be \\n  in close agreement about the values of the \\n  likelihoods.[7]\", \"\\nFor now we will suppose that the likelihoods have objective or \\nintersubjectively agreed values, common to all agents in a scientific \\ncommunity. Let us mark this agreement by dropping the subscript \\n\\u2018\\u03b1\\u2019, \\u2018\\u03b2\\u2019, etc., from expressions \\nthat represent likelihoods. One might worry that this supposition is \\noverly strong. There are many legitimate scientific contexts where, \\nalthough scientists should have enough of a common understanding of \\nthe empirical import of hypotheses to assign quite similar \\nvalues to likelihoods, precise agreement on the numerical \\nvalues is unrealistic. This point is right. So later we will see how \\nto relax the supposition that likelihood values agree precisely. But \\nfor now the main ideas behind probabilistic inductive logic will be \\nmore easily explained if we focus on those contexts were objective or \\nintersubjectively agreed likelihoods are available. Later we will see that much the same logic continues to apply \\nin contexts where the values of likelihoods may be somewhat vague, or \\nwhere members of the scientific community disagree to some extent \\nabout their values.\", \"\\nAn adequate treatment of the likelihoods calls for the introduction \\nof one additional notational device. Scientific hypotheses are \\ngenerally tested by a sequence of experiments or observations \\nconducted over a period of time. To explicitly represent the \\naccumulation of evidence, let the series of sentences \\nc1, c2, \\u2026,  \\ncn, describe the conditions under which a \\nsequence of experiments or observations are conducted.

In many \\ncases the likelihood of the evidence stream will be equal \\nto the product of the likelihoods of the individual outcomes:\", \"When this equality holds the individual bits of evidence are said to be \\nprobabilistically independent on the hypothesis. In what \\nfollows such independence will only be assumed in those \\nplaces where it is explicitly invoked.\", \"\\nIn the probabilistic logic of evidential support the evaluation of a hypothesis on \\nevidence is represented by its posterior probability,  \\nP\\u03b1[hi | b\\u00b7cn\\u00b7en].

But another factor, the prior probability of \\nthe hypothesis based on considerations expressed within b,  \\nP\\u03b1[hi | b], also makes a \\ncontribution. It represents the weight of all non-evidential \\nplausibility considerations on which posterior probabilities may \\ndepend. It turns out that posterior probabilities depend only  \\non the values of (ratios of) likelihoods and on the values of \\n(ratios of) prior probabilities.\", \"\\nTo understand the role of prior probabilities, consider the \\nHIV test example described in the previous section. What the physician \\nand patient want to know is the value of the posterior probability \\n P\\u03b1[h | \\nb\\u00b7c\\u00b7e] that the \\npatient has HIV, h, given the evidence of the positive test, \\nc\\u00b7e, and given the error rates of the test, \\ndescribed within b. The value of this posterior probability depends on the \\nlikelihood (due to the error rates) of this patient obtaining a \\ntrue-positive result,  \\n P[e | \\nh\\u00b7b\\u00b7c] = .99, and of \\nobtaining a false positive result,  \\n P[e | \\n~h\\u00b7b\\u00b7c] = .05. In addition, the \\nvalue of the of the posterior probability depends on how plausible it \\nis that the patient has HIV before the test results are taken into \\naccount,  \\n P\\u03b1[h | \\nb]. In the context of medical diagnosis this prior \\nprobability is sometimes called the base rate. It represents the probability \\nthat the patient may have contracted HIV based on his \\nrisk group (i.e., whether he is an IV drug user, has unprotected sex \\nwith multiple partners, etc.). Such information should be explicitly \\nstated, and represented within b as well. To see its importance, consider the \\nfollowing numerical results (which may be calculated using the formula \\ncalled Bayes' Theorem, presented in the next section).  If the \\nbase rate for the patient's risk group is relatively high, say  \\n P\\u03b1[h | \\nb] = .10, then the positive test result yields a \\nprobability for his having HIV of  \\n P\\u03b1[h | \\nb\\u00b7c\\u00b7e] = .69. However, \\nif the patient is in a very low risk group,  \\n P\\u03b1[h | \\nb] = .001, then a positive test only raises the \\nprobability of HIV infection to  \\n P\\u03b1[h | \\nb\\u00b7c\\u00b7e] = .02.  This \\nposterior probability is much higher than the prior probability of \\n.001, but should not worry the patient too much. This positive test \\nresult is more likely due to the false-positive rate of the test than \\nto the presence of HIV. (This sort of test, with such a large \\nfalse-positive rate, .05, is best used as a screening test; a positive \\nresult should lead to a second, more rigorous, more expensive \\ntest.)\", \"\\nIn the evidential evaluation of scientific theories, prior \\nprobabilities often represent assessments by agents of non-evidential, \\nconceptually motivated plausibility weightings among \\nhypotheses. However, because such plausibility assessments tend to \\nvary among agents, critics often brand them as merely \\nsubjective, and take their role in probabilistic induction to be \\nhighly problematic. Bayesian inductivists counter that such \\nassessments often play an important role in the sciences, especially \\nwhen there is insufficient evidence to distinguish among some of the \\nalternative hypotheses. And, they argue, the epithet merely \\nsubjective is unwarranted. Such plausibility assessments are \\noften backed by extensive arguments that may draw on forceful \\nconceptual considerations.\", \"\\nConsider, for example, the kind of plausibility arguments that have \\nbeen brought to bear on the various interpretations of quantum theory \\n(e.g., those related to the measurement problem). These arguments go \\nto the heart of conceptual issues that were central to the development \\nof the theory. Indeed, many of these issues were first raised by the \\nscientists who made the greatest contributions to the theory's \\ndevelopment, in the attempt to get a conceptual hold on the theory and \\nits implications. Such arguments seem \\nto play a legitimate role in the assessment of alternative views when \\ndistinguishing evidence has yet to be found.\", \"\\nMore generally, scientists often bring plausibility arguments to bear \\nin assessing their views. Although such arguments are seldom decisive, \\nthey may bring the scientific community into widely shared agreement, \\nespecially regarding the implausibility of some logically \\npossible alternatives. This seems to be the primary epistemic role of \\nthe thought experiment. Thus, although prior probabilities may be \\nsubjective in the sense that agents may disagree on the relative \\nstrengths of plausibility arguments\\u2014and so disagree on the \\ncomparative plausibilities of various hypotheses\\u2014the priors \\nused in scientific contexts should not represent mere subjective \\nwhims. Rather, they should be supported (or at least be supportable) \\nby explicit arguments regarding how much more plausible one hypothesis \\nis than another. The important role of plausibility assessments is \\napparent in such received bits of scientific wisdom as the old saw \\nthat extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. That \\nis, it takes especially strong evidence, in the form of extremely high \\nvalues for ratios of likelihoods, to overcome the extremely low \\nplausibility values possessed by some hypotheses. We'll see precisely \\nhow this idea works in the next section, and return to it again in Section 3.5. \", \"\\nWhen sufficiently strong evidence becomes available, it turns out that prior plausibility assessments may be \\u201cwashed out\\u201d or overridden by the evidence. We'll see how this works in Sections 4 and 5. Thus, prior plausibility assessments play their most important role when the kind of evidence for which hypotheses specify likelihoods is still fairly sparse. It will be shown that provided the value of the prior probability of a true hypothesis isn't assessed to be zero, as evidence accumulates the influence of the values of the prior probabilities will very probably fade away as evidence accumulates.\", \"\\nSome Bayesian logicists (e.g., Carnap) have maintained that posterior \\nprobabilities of hypotheses should be determined by logical form \\nalone. The idea is that the likelihoods might reasonably be specified \\nin terms of logical form; so if logical form might be made to \\ndetermine the values of prior probabilities as well, then inductive \\nlogic would be fully \\u201cformal\\u201d in the same way that \\ndeductive logic is \\u201cformal\\u201d. Keynes and Carnap tried to implement this \\nidea through syntactic versions of the principle of indifference\\u2014the idea that syntactically similar hypotheses should be \\nassigned the same prior probability values.

Goodmanian grue-predicates provide one way to \\nillustrate the \\n point.[8] \\n Furthermore, as suggested earlier, for this idea to apply to the \\n evidential support of real scientific theories,\\nscientists would have to assess the prior probabilities of each \\nalternative theory based only on its syntactic structure. That \\nseems an unreasonable way to proceed. Are we to evaluate the \\nprior probabilities of alternative theories of gravitation,\\nor of alternative  quantum theories, by exploring only their syntactic \\nstructures, with absolutely no regard for their semantic \\ncontent\\u2014with no regard for what they say about \\nthe world? This seems an extremely dubious\\napproach to the evaluation of real scientific theories.\\nLogical structure alone cannot, and should not suffice for \\ndetermining reasonable prior probability values for real scientific \\ntheories. Moreover, real scientific hypotheses and theories are \\ninevitably subject to plausibility considerations based on what \\nthey say about the world. Prior probabilities are well-suited \\nto represent the weight  of such plausibility \\nconsiderations, vague as they may be.\", \"\\nWe will return to  prior probabilities in a bit. But \\nfirst let's see how  likelihoods combine with prior \\nprobabilities to yield posterior probabilities for hypotheses.\", \"\\nAny probabilistic inductive logic that draws on the usual\\naxioms of probability theory to represent how evidence supports\\nhypotheses must be a Bayesian inductive logic in the broad\\nsense.  For, Bayes' Theorem is just a simple theorem of probability\\ntheory. Its importance is due to the relationship it expresses between\\nhypotheses and evidence. The theorem shows how, through the\\nlikelihoods, evidence combines with prior probabilities (prior\\nplausibility assessments) to produce posterior probabilities\\n(posterior plausibility values) for hypotheses. Thus, any logic of\\nhypothesis evaluation of this sort is a Bayesian Confirmation\\nTheory.\", \"\\nLet's now examine several forms of Bayes' Theorem, each derivable \\nfrom axioms 1\\u20135.  The simplest is this:\", \"\\nThis equation expresses the posterior probability of  \\nhi, P\\u03b1[hi \\n| \\nb\\u00b7cn\\u00b7en], \\nin terms of the likelihood of the evidence on the hypothesis \\n(together with background and observation conditions),  \\n P[en \\n| \\nhi\\u00b7b\\u00b7cn], \\nthe prior probability of the hypothesis (given background \\nconditions),  \\n P\\u03b1[hi | b], and the simple probability of the \\nevidence (given background and observation conditions),  \\n P\\u03b1[en | b\\u00b7cn]. \\n This latter probability is sometimes called the expectedness of \\nthe evidence. \", \"\\nThis version of Bayes' Theorem also includes a term,  \\n (P\\u03b1[cn | hi\\u00b7b] / \\nP\\u03b1[cn | b]), that represents the ratio of the likelihood \\nof the experimental conditions on the hypothesis and background \\nto the \\u201clikelihood\\u201d of the experimental \\nconditions on the background alone. Bayes' Theorem is usually \\nexpressed in a way that suppresses this factor by building \\ncn into the background \\nb. However, if cn is built into \\nb, then technically b must change as new evidence is \\naccumulated.  So it is better to make this factor explicit and see how to \\ndeal with it logically.  Arguably the term  \\n (P\\u03b1[cn \\n| hi\\u00b7b] / \\nP\\u03b1[cn | \\nb]) should be 1, or be very near 1, since the truth of the \\nhypothesis at issue should not significantly affect how likely it is \\nthat the experimental conditions are satisfied. If various alternative \\nhypotheses assign significantly different likelihoods to the \\nexperimental conditions, then such conditions should more properly be \\nincluded in the evidential outcomes \\nen.\", \"\\nBoth the prior probability of the hypothesis and \\nthe expectedness tend to be somewhat subjective factors \\nin that various agents from the same scientific community may legitimately \\ndisagree on what values these factors should take. Bayesian logicians \\nusually accept the subjectivity of the prior probabilities of \\nhypotheses, but find the subjectivity of the \\nexpectedness to be more troubling. This is due at least in part\\nto the fact that in a Bayesian logic of evidential support the value of the \\nexpectedness cannot be independent of likelihoods and the prior probabilities\\nof hypotheses. That is, when for each member of a set of alternative hypotheses the \\nlikelihood P[en | \\nhj\\u00b7b\\u00b7cn] has an objective \\n(or intersubjectively agreed) value, \\n  the expectedness is constrained by the following equation (where the sum ranges \\n  over a mutually exclusive and exhaustive set of alternative hypotheses \\n  {h1, h2, \\u2026, hm, \\u2026}, which may be finite or infinite):\", \"This equation implies that the value of the expectedness must lie \\n  between the largest and smallest of the various likelihood values due to specific hypotheses. And it shows that the values for the prior probabilities together with the\\n  values of the likelihoods should uniquely determine the value for the expectedness of the evidence.\\n  This result reflects the idea that, according to an evidential support\\n  function, evidence claims are not \\\"simply likely\\\" to a certain degree on their own, \\n  independently of what any hypothesis has to say.\\n    Rather, the likelihoods of evidence claims are fundamentally fixed \\n    relative to the relevant hypotheses.

In cases where some alternative hypotheses remain unspecified (or undiscovered), \\n    the expectedness is constrained in principle by the totality of possible alternative hypotheses, but there is no way to figure out precisely what its value should be.\", \"The troubles raised by the expectedness of the evidence term may be circumvented by appealing to another form of Bayes' Theorem, a ratio form that compares hypotheses a pair at a time:\", \"\\nThe condition \\u2018P\\u03b1[cn | hj\\u00b7b] / P\\u03b1[cn | hi\\u00b7b] = 1\\u2019 says that cn is no more likely on  \\nhi\\u00b7b than on hj\\u00b7b\\u2014i.e., that neither hypothesis makes the occurrence of experimental or observation conditions more likely than the other.[9]  \", \"\\nThis Ratio Form of Bayes' Theorem expresses how much more plausible, \\non the evidence, one hypothesis is than another. Notice that \\nthe likelihood ratios carry the full import of \\nthe evidence. The evidence influences the evaluation of hypotheses in \\nno other way. The only other factor that influences the value of the ratio of posterior probabilities is the ratio of the prior probabilities. When the likelihoods are fully objective, any subjectivity that affects the ratio of posteriors can only arise via subjectivity in the ratio of the priors. \", \" \\nThis version of Bayes's Theorem shows that in order to evaluate the posterior probability ratios for pairs of hypotheses, the prior probabilities of hypotheses need not be evaluated absolutely; only their ratios are needed. That is, with regard to the priors, the Bayesian evaluation of hypotheses only relies on how much more plausible one hypothesis is than another (due to considerations expressed within b). This kind of Bayesian evaluation of hypotheses is essentially comparative in that only ratios of likelihoods and ratios of prior probabilities are ever really needed for the assessment of scientific hypotheses. Furthermore, we will soon see that the absolute values of the posterior probabilities of hypotheses entirely derive from the posterior probability ratios provided by the Ratio Form of Bayes' Theorem. \", \"\\nLet's consider a simple example of how the Ratio Form of the theorem may be utilized. Suppose we possess a warped coin and \\nwant to determine its propensity for heads when tossed in the usual way. We may compare \\ntwo hypotheses, h[q] \\n and h[r], that propose that the propensity for the coin to come up heads on the usual kind of toss is q and r, respectively. Let \\ncn report that the coin is tossed n times in the normal \\nway, and let en report a total m heads.  Supposing that the outcomes of tosses are probabilistically independent relative to each of the two hypotheses, line 3 of Equation \\n(9) yields the following equation, where the likelihood ratio is the ratio of the respective binomial terms:\", \"\\nWhen, for instance, the coin is tossed n = 100 times and comes up \\nheads m = 72 times, the evidence for hypothesis \\nh[1/2] as compared to h[3/4] is given by the \\nlikelihood ratio \\n[(1/2)72(1/2)28]/[(3/4)72(1/4)28] \\n= .000056269. So, even if prior to the evidence, plausibility considerations (expressed within b) make it 100 \\ntimes more plausible that the coin is fair than that it is warped \\ntowards heads with propensity 3/4\\u2014i.e., even if  \\nP\\u03b1[h[1/2] | b] / \\nP\\u03b1[h[3/4] | b] = 100\\u2014the \\nevidence provided by these tosses makes the posterior plausibility \\nthat the coin is fair only about 6/1000th as plausible as \\nthe hypothesis that it is warped towards heads with propensity 3/4\\u2014i.e.,  \\n P\\u03b1[h[1/2] | b\\u00b7cn\\u00b7en] / \\n P\\u03b1[h[3/4] | b\\u00b7cn\\u00b7en]  \\n = .0056269. Thus, such evidence strongly refutes the  \\n\\u201cfairness hypothesis\\u201d relative to the  \\n\\u201c3/4-heads-propensity hypothesis\\u201d, provided the \\nassessment of prior probabilities (i.e., prior plausibilities) doesn't make the latter hypothesis \\ntoo extremely implausible to begin with. Notice, however, \\nthat strong refutation is not absolute \\nrefutation. Additional evidence could reverse this trend towards \\nthe strong refutation of the \\u201cfairness hypothesis\\u201d.\", \"\\nThis example employs repetitions of the same kind of experiment\\u2014repeated tosses of a coin.

If, as the evidence increases, the likelihood \\nratios P[en | hj\\u00b7b\\u00b7cn] / \\n  P[en | hi\\u00b7b\\u00b7cn] \\napproach 0, then the Ratio Form of Bayes' Theorem, Equation 9, shows \\nthat the posterior probability of hj must approach 0 as \\nwell.

This qualification is introduced to \\naccommodate a conception of evidential support called \\nLikelihoodism, which is especially influential among \\nstatisticians.  Also, the likelihoods in the law are expressed with \\nthe subscript \\u03b1 attached to indicate that the law holds for each \\ninductive support function P\\u03b1, even when the \\nvalues of the likelihoods are not objective or agreed on by all agents \\nin a given scientific community. These two features of the law are \\nclosely related, as we will see.\", \"\\nEach probabilistic support function satisfies the axioms of \\nSection 2. According to these axioms the conditional probability of \\none sentence on another is always defined. So, in the context of the \\ninductive logic of support functions the likelihoods \\nare always defined, and the qualifying clause about this in the  \\n General Law of Likelihood is automatically \\nsatisfied. For inductive support functions, all of the \\nversions of Bayes' theorem (Equations 8-11) continue to hold even \\nwhen the likelihoods are not objective or intersubjectively agreed on \\nby the scientific community.  In many scientific contexts \\nthere will be general agreement on the values of likelihoods; but whenever such \\nagreement fails the subscripts \\u03b1, \\u03b2, etc. must remain \\nattached to the support function likelihoods to indicate this.  Even \\nso, the General Law of Likelihood continues to \\nhold for each support function.\", \"\\nThere is a view, or family of views, called likelihoodism \\nthat maintains that the inductive logician or statistician should only be \\nconcerned with whether the evidence provides increased \\nor decreased support for one hypothesis over another, and \\nonly in cases where this evaluation is based on the ratios of \\ncompletely objective likelihoods. (Prominent  likelihoodists include Edwards (1972) and Royall (1997); also see Forster and Sober (2004) and Fitelson (2007).) When the likelihoods \\ninvolved are objective, the ratios  \\nP[en | hj\\u00b7b\\u00b7cn] \\n/ P[e  \\nn | hi\\u00b7b\\u00b7cn]  \\nprovide a pure, objective measure of how strongly the \\nevidence supports hi as compared \\nto hj, a measure that is \\u201cuntainted\\u201d by prior plausibility \\nconsiderations. According to likelihoodists, only this kind of \\npure measure is scientifically appropriate for the assessment \\nof how evidence impacts hypotheses. (It should be noted that the classical \\nschool of statistics, associated with R.A. Fisher (1922) and with Neyman and Pearson (1967), reject \\nthe claim about the nature of evidential support expressed by the General Law of Likelihood.)\", \"\\nLikelihoodists maintain that it is not appropriate for statisticians \\nto incorporate assumptions about prior probabilities of hypotheses \\ninto the assessment of evidential support. It is not their place to \\ncompute recommended values of posterior probabilities for the \\nscientific community. When the results of experiments are made public, \\nsay in scientific journals, only objective likelihoods should be \\nreported. The evaluation of the impact of objective likelihoods on \\nagents' posterior probabilities depends on each agent's \\nindividual subjective prior probability, which represents \\nplausibility considerations that have nothing to do with the \\nevidence. So, likelihoodists suggest, posterior probabilities should be left for  individuals to \\ncompute, if they desire to do so. \", \"\\nThe conditional probabilities between most pairs of sentences fail to be \\nobjectively defined in a way that suits likelihoodists. So, \\nfor likelihoodists, the general logic of support functions (captured by \\nthe axioms of Section 2) cannot represent an objective \\nlogic of evidential support for hypotheses.  Because they \\neschew the logic of support functions, likelihoodist do not \\nhave Bayes' theorem available, and so cannot derive the Law \\nof Likelihood from it. Rather, they must state the  \\n Law of Likelihood as an axiom of \\ntheir inductive logic, an axiom that applies only when the likelihoods \\nhave well-defined objective values.\", \"\\nLikelihoodists tend to have a very strict conception of what \\nit takes for likelihoods to be well-defined. They consider a \\nlikelihood to be well-defined only when it is (what we \\nreferred to earlier as) a direct inference likelihood\\u2014\\ni.e., only when either, (1) the hypothesis (together with background \\nand experimental conditions) logically entails the data, or (2) the \\nhypothesis (together with background) logically entails an explicit \\nsimple statistical hypothesis that (together with \\nexperimental conditions) specifies precise probabilities for each \\nof the events that make up the evidence.  \", \"\\nLikelihoodists contrast simple statistical \\nhypotheses with composite statistical hypotheses, which \\nonly entail vague, or imprecise, or directional claims about \\nthe statistical probabilities of evidential events. Whereas a \\nsimple statistical hypothesis might say, for example,  \\n\\u201cthe chance of heads on tosses of the coin is precisely \\n.65\\u201d, a composite statistical hypothesis might say, \\n\\u201cthe chance of heads on tosses is either .65 or \\n.75\\u201d, or it may be a directional hypothesis that says, \\n\\u201cthe chance of heads on tosses is greater than \\n.65\\u201d. Likelihoodists maintain that composite \\nhypotheses are not an appropriate basis for well-defined \\nlikelihoods. Such hypotheses represent a kind of disjunction of simple \\nstatistical hypotheses. The direction hypothesis, for \\ninstance, is essentially a disjunction of the various simple \\nstatistical hypotheses that assign specific values above .65 to \\nthe chances of heads on tosses. Likelihoods based on such hypotheses \\nare not appropriately objective by the lights of the \\nlikelihoodist because they must in effect depend on factors \\nthat represent the degree to which the composite hypothesis \\nsupports each of the simple statistical hypotheses that it \\nencompasses; and likelihoodists consider such factors too \\nsubjective to be permitted in a logic that should permit only objective \\n likelihoods.[13]\", \"\\nTaking all of this into account, the version of the Law of \\nLikelihood appropriate to likelihoodists may be \\nstated as follows.\", \"\\nNotice that when either version of the Law of \\nLikelihood holds, the absolute size of a likelihood is \\nirrelevant to the strength of the evidence. All that matters is the \\nrelative size of the likelihoods for one hypothesis as compared to \\nanother.

Suppose that e1 is 1000 \\ntimes more likely on hi (given b\\u00b7c1) than \\nis e2 on hi (given b\\u00b7c2); and \\nsuppose that e1 is also 1000 times more likely on  \\nhj (given b\\u00b7c1) than is e2 on  \\nhj (given b\\u00b7c2)\\u2014i.e., suppose \\nthat  \\nP\\u03b1[e1 | hi\\u00b7b\\u00b7c1] \\n= 1000 \\u00d7  \\n P\\u03b1[e2 | hi\\u00b7b\\u00b7c1], \\nand P\\u03b1[e1 | hj\\u00b7b\\u00b7c1] \\u00a0=\\u00a0 \\n 1000 \\u00d7 P\\u03b1[e2 | hj\\u00b7b\\u00b7c2]. \\n Which piece of evidence, (c1\\u00b7e1) or \\n (c2\\u00b7e2), is stronger evidence with regard \\nto the comparison of hi to hj?  The Law \\nof Likelihood implies both are equally strong.

However, most of what will be \\nsaid about likelihoods, especially the convergence result in Section \\n5, applies to likelihoodist likelihoods as well. We will, \\nhowever, continue to suppose that likelihoods are objective   \\nin the sense that all members of the scientific community agree on \\ntheir numerical values. In Section 6 we will see how even this supposition may be relaxed in scientific contexts where completely objective values for likelihoods are not realistically available.\", \"\\nGiven that a scientific community should largely agree on the values \\nof the likelihoods, any significant disagreement among them with regard to the values of \\nposterior probabilities of hypotheses should derive from \\ndisagreements over their assessments of values for the prior probabilities of those hypotheses. We saw in section 3.3 that the Bayesian logic of evidential support need only rely on assessments of ratios of prior probabilities\\u2014on how much more plausible one hypothesis is than another. Furthermore, presumably, in scientific contexts the\\ncomparative plausibility values for hypotheses should depend on explicit plausibility arguments (stated within b), not on privately held opinions. (It would be highly\\nunscientific for a member of the scientific community to disregard or dismiss a hypothesis that other members take to be a reasonable proposal with only the comment: \\n \\u201cdon't ask me to give reasons, it's just my opinion\\u201d.) Even so, \\nagents may be unable to specify precisely how much more strongly the available plausibility arguments support a hypothesis over an alternative; so prior probability\\nratios for hypotheses may be vague. Furthermore, agents in a scientific community may disagree about how strongly the available plausibility arguments support a hypothesis over a rival hypothesis; so prior probability ratios may be somewhat diverse as well. \", \"Both the vagueness of prior plausibility ratio values for \\nindividual agents and the diversity of values among the community of \\nagents can be represented formally by sets of probabilistic support \\nfunctions, {P\\u03b1, P\\u03b2, \\n\\u2026}, that agree on the values for the likelihoods but encompass \\na range of values for the (ratios of) prior probabilities of \\nhypotheses. \\nVagueness and diversity are somewhat different issues, but \\nthey may be represented in much the same way. Let's consider each in \\nturn.\", \"\\nAssessments of the prior plausibilities of hypotheses will often be vague\\u2014not subject to the kind of \\nprecise quantitative treatment that a Bayesian version of \\nprobabilistic inductive logic may seem to require for prior \\nprobabilities. So, it is sometimes objected, the kind of assessment of \\nprior probabilities required to get the Bayesian algorithm going \\ncannot be accomplished in practice. To see how Bayesian inductivists address this worry, first recall the Ratio Form of Bayes' Theorem, equation (9).\", \"Recall that this Ratio Form of the theorem captures the essential features of the logic of evidential support, even though it only provides a value for the ratio of the posterior probabilities.

In practice one \\nneed only assess bounds for these prior plausibility ratios to achieve meaningful results. Given a prior ratio in a specific interval, \", \"Observe that if the likelihood ratio values LRn approach 0 as the amount of evidence en increases, the interval of values for the posterior probability ratio becomes tighter as the upper bound (LRn\\u00d7r) approaches 0.

(I'll provide the details \\nof this Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem in section 5.) When that happens, \\nthe upper bound on the posterior probability ratio also approaches 0, driving the posterior \\nprobability of hj to approach 0, effectively refuting \\nhypothesis hj. Thus, false competitors of a true hypothesis will \\neffectively be eliminated by increasing evidence.

It only need draw on bounds on comparative plausibility ratios, \\nand these bounds only play a significant role while evidence remains fairly sparse. If the true hypothesis is comparatively plausible (due to plausibility arguments \\ncontained in b), then plausibility assessments give it a leg-up over alternatives. If the true hypothesis is comparatively implausible, the plausibility \\nassessments merely slow down the rate at which it comes to dominate its rivals, reflecting the idea that extraordinary hypotheses require extraordinary \\nevidence (or an extraordinary accumulation of evidence) to overcome their initial implausibilities. \", \"Thus, as evidence accumulates, the agent's vague initial \\nplausibility assessments transform into quite sharp posterior \\nprobabilities that indicate the strong refutation or support of the \\nvarious hypotheses.

Furthermore, if accumulating evidence drives the likelihood \\nratios to extremes, the range of functions in a diversity set \\nwill come to near agreement, near 0 or 1, on the values for posterior \\nprobabilities of hypotheses. So, not only does such evidence firm \\nup each agent's vague initial plausibilities, it also brings the \\nwhole community into agreement on the near refutation of \\nempirically distinct competitors of a true hypothesis.\", \"\\nUnder what conditions might the likelihood ratios go to such extremes \\nas evidence accumulates, effectively washing out vagueness and \\ndiversity? The Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem \\n(discussed in detail in Section 5) implies that if a true hypothesis \\ndisagrees with false alternatives on the likelihoods of possible \\noutcomes for a long enough stream of experiments or observations, \\nthen that evidence stream will very probably produce actual \\noutcomes that drive the likelihood ratios of false alternatives \\nas compared to the true hypothesis to approach 0. As this happens, \\nalmost any range of prior plausibility assessments will be driven to \\nagreement on the posterior plausibilities for hypotheses. Thus, the \\naccumulating evidence will very probably bring all support functions \\nin the vagueness and diversity sets for a community \\nof agents to near agreement on posterior plausibility values\\u2014\\nnear 0 for the false competitors, and near 1 for the true hypothesis \\n(or for its disjunction with empirically indistinguishable \\nalternatives).  \", \"\\nOne more point about prior probabilities and Bayesian convergence \\nshould be mentioned here. Some subjectivist versions of Bayesian induction \\nseem to suggest that an agent's prior plausibility assessments for \\nhypotheses should stay fixed once and for all, and that all \\nplausibility updating should be brought about via the likelihoods in \\naccord with Bayes' Theorem. Critics argue that this is \\nunreasonable. The members of a scientific community may quite \\nlegitimately revise their (comparative) prior plausibility assessments for \\nhypotheses from time to time as they rethink plausibility arguments \\nand bring new considerations to bear.  This seems a natural part of \\nthe conceptual development of a science. It turns out that such \\nreassessments of priors poses no difficulty for probabilistic inductive \\nlogic as I've described it here.  Reassessments may come about by the addition of \\nexplicit statements that supplement or modify the background \\ninformation b, and they may also take the form of (non-Bayesian) \\ntransitions to new vagueness sets for individual agents and \\nto new diversity sets for the community. The logic \\nof Bayesian induction (as described here) has nothing to say about what values the prior \\nplausibility assessments for hypotheses should have; and it places no \\nrestrictions on how they might change.  Provided that the series of \\nreassessments of prior plausibilities doesn't push the prior of the true hypothesis \\never nearer to zero, the Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem \\nimplies that the evidence will very probably bring the posterior \\nprobabilities of empirically distinct rivals of the true hypothesis to \\napproach 0 via decreasing likelihood ratios; and as this happens, the \\nposterior probability of the true hypothesis will head towards 1.\", \"\\nIn this section we'll see that for the special case of \\nenumerative inductions probabilistic inductive logic satisfies the \\nCriterion of Adequacy (CoA) stated at the beginning of this article. \\nThat is, under some plausible conditions, given a reasonable amount of \\nevidence, the degree to which that evidence comes to \\nsupport a hypothesis through enumerative induction is very \\nlikely to approach 1 for true hypotheses.  We will now see precisely how this \\nworks.\", \"\\nRecall that in enumerative inductions the idea is to infer the \\nproportion, or relative frequency, of an attribute in a \\npopulation from how frequently the attribute occurs in a sample of the \\npopulation.

However, such inferences are very common, \\nand so worthy of careful attention. They arise, for example, in the \\ncontext of polling and in many other cases where a population \\nfrequency is estimated from a sample.  We will establish conditions \\nunder which such inferences give rise to highly objective posterior \\nprobabilities, posterior probabilities that are extremely stable over a \\nwide range of reasonable prior plausibility assessments. That is, we \\nwill consider all of the inductive support functions in an agent's \\nvagueness set V or in a community's diversity \\nset D.

Let us look at several numerical examples to make clear how \\nstrong this result really is.\", \"\\nThe first section of this article provided two examples of enumerative \\ninductive inferences. Consider Example 1. Let \\u2018B\\u2019 \\nrepresent the population of all ravens. Let \\u2018A\\u2019 \\nrepresent the class of black ravens. Now consider those hypotheses of \\nform \\u2018F[A,B] = \\nr\\u2019 for r in the interval between .99 \\nand 1. This collection of hypotheses includes the claim that \\n\\u201call ravens are black\\u201d together with those alternative \\nhypotheses that claim the frequency of being black among ravens is \\nwithin .01 of 1. The alternatives to these hypotheses are just those \\nthat \\nassert \\u2018F[A,B] \\n= s\\u2019 for values of s below .99.\", \"\\nSuppose none of the support functions represented in the \\nvagueness or diversity set under consideration rates \\nthe prior plausibility of any of the hypotheses \\u2018F[A,B] = \\ns\\u2019 with s less than .99 to be more than twice as \\nplausible as the hypotheses \\u2018F[A,B] = r\\u2019 for which r \\nis between .99 and 1. That is, suppose, for each P\\u03b1 \\nin the vagueness or diversity set under \\nconsideration, the prior plausibility P\\u03b1[F[A,B] = s |\\n b] for hypotheses with s below .99 is never more than \\nK = 2 times greater than the prior plausibility \\nP\\u03b1[F[A,B] = r | b] for hypotheses with r \\nbetween .99 and 1. Then, on the evidence of 400 ravens selected \\nrandomly with respect to color, the theorem yields the following bound \\nfor all P\\u03b1 in the vagueness or \\ndiversity set:\", \"  \\n\\u2002 P\\u03b1[F[A,B] >.99  | b \\u00b7 F[A,S] = 1 \\u00b7 Rnd[S,B,A] \\u00b7 Size[S] = 400] \\u00a0\\u2265\\u00a0 \\n  .9651.  \", \"\\nThe following table describes similar results for other upper bounds K on values of prior \\nprobability ratios and other sample sizes n: \", \"\\n(All probabilities with entries \\u20181.0000\\u2019 in this table \\nand the next actually have values slightly less than one, but nearly \\nequal 1.0000 to four significant decimal places.)\", \"\\nTo see what the table tells us, consider the third to last row. It \\nrepresents what happens when a vagueness or \\ndiversity set contains at least some support functions that \\nassign prior probabilities (i.e., prior plausibilities) nearly one hundred thousand times \\nhigher to some hypotheses asserting frequencies not between \\n.99 and 1 than it assigns to hypotheses asserting frequencies between \\n.99 and 1. The table shows that even in such cases, a random sample of \\n1600 black ravens will, nevertheless, pull the posterior plausibility \\nlevel that \\u201cthe true frequency is above .99\\u201d to a value \\nabove .9898, for every support function in the set. And if the \\nvagueness or diversity set contains support \\nfunctions that assign even more extreme priors, say, priors that are \\nnearly ten million times higher for some hypotheses asserting \\nfrequencies below .99 than for hypotheses within .99 of 1 (the table's \\nlast row), this poses no great problem for convergence-to-agreement. A \\nrandom sample of 3200 black ravens will yield posterior probabilities (i.e., posterior plausibilities) \\nindistinguishable from 1 for the claim that \\u201cmore than 99% of \\nall ravens are black\\u201d.\", \"\\nStrong support can be gotten for an even narrower range of hypotheses \\nabout the percentage of black birds among the ravens. But a larger \\nsample size is needed for this.  For an additional example, see the \\nsupplementary document\", \"\\nNow consider the second example of an enumerative induction provided at  the beginning of this article, involving the \\npoll about the presidential preferences of voters.

In the next \\nsection we establish a CoA result that applies much more generally. It \\napplies to the inductive support of hypotheses in any context where \\ncompeting hypotheses are empirically distinct enough to disagree, at \\nleast a little, on the likelihoods of possible evidential outcomes.\", \"\\nIn this section we will investigate the Likelihood Ratio \\nConvergence Theorem.

So, support functions in collections \\nrepresenting vague prior plausibilities for an individual agent (i.e., \\na vagueness set) and representing the diverse range of priors \\nfor a community of agents (i.e., a diversity set) will very \\nlikely come to agree on the near 0 posterior probability of \\nempirically distinct false rivals of a true hypothesis.  And as the \\nposterior probabilities of false competitors fall, the posterior \\nprobability of the true hypothesis heads towards 1. Thus, the theorem \\nestablishes that the inductive logic of probabilistic support \\nfunctions satisfies the Criterion of Adequacy (CoA).\", \"\\nThe Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem overcomes \\nmany of the objections raised by critics of Bayesian convergence \\nresults.

It only concerns the probability of a particular \\ndisjunctive sentence that expresses a disjunction of various possible sequences of experimental or observational outcomes. The \\ntheorem does not require evidence to consist of sequences of events \\nthat, according to the hypothesis, are identically distributed (like \\nrepeated tosses of a die). Although the result is most easily expressed in cases where the sequence of outcomes are probabilistically independent relative to each hypothesis, a version of the theorem also holds when \\nthe individual outcomes of the evidence stream are not \\nprobabilistically independent on the hypotheses.  The result does not \\nrely on countable additivity. And the explicit lower bounds it \\nprovides on convergence means that there is no need to wait for the infinitely long run before convergence occurs (as some critics seem to think).\", \"\\nIt is sometimes claimed that Bayesian convergence results only work \\nwhen an agent locks in values for the prior probabilities of \\nhypotheses once and for all, and updates posterior probabilities from \\nthere only by conditioning on evidence via Bayes Theorem. The \\nLikelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem, however, \\napplies even if agents revise their prior probability assessments \\nover time.  Such non-Bayesian shifts from one support function (or \\nvagueness set) to another may arise from new plausibility \\narguments or from reassessments of the strengths of old \\nones. The Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem itself \\nonly involves the values of likelihoods. So, provided such \\nreassessments don't push the prior probability of the true \\nhypothesis towards 0 too rapidly, the theorem implies that \\nthe posterior probabilities of each empirically distinct false \\ncompetitor will very probably approach 0 as evidence \\n increases.[18]\", \"\\nTo specify the details of the Likelihood Ratio Convergence \\nTheorem we'll need a few additional notational \\nconventions and definitions.

However, it only takes account of the influence of the possibly falsifying experiments or observations. It completely ignores the influence of any experiments or observations in the evidence stream on which hypothesis hj is \\nfully outcome-compatible with hypothesis hi. We now turn to a theorem that applies to those evidence streams (or to parts of evidence streams) consisting only of experiments and observations on which hypothesis hj is \\nfully outcome-compatible with hypothesis hi. Evidence streams of this kind contain no possibly falsifying outcomes. In such cases   the only outcomes of an experiment or observation ck for which hypothesis hj may specify 0 likelihoods are those for   which hypothesis hi specifies 0 likelihoods as well. \", \"Hypotheses whose connection with the evidence is entirely statistical in nature will inevitably be fully outcome-compatible on the entire evidence stream. So, evidence streams of this kind are undoubtedly much more common in practice than those containing possibly falsifying outcomes. Furthermore, whenever an entire stream of evidence contains some mixture of experiments and observations on which the hypotheses are not fully outcome compatible along with others on which they are fully outcome compatible, we may treat the experiments and observations for which full outcome compatiblity holds as a seperate subsequence of the entire evidence stream, to see the likely impact of that part of the evidence in producing values for likelihood ratios. \", \"\\nTo cover evidence streams (or subsequences of evidence streams) consisting entirely of experiments or observations on which hj is \\nfully outcome-compatible with hypothesis hi we will first need to identify a useful way to measure the degree to which \\nhypotheses are empirically distinct from one another on such evidence. \\nConsider some particular sequence of outcomes en that \\nresults from observations cn.

On this measure hypotheses hi and hj assign \\nthe same likelihood value to a given outcome oku just \\nwhen \\nQI[oku | hi/hj | b\\u00b7ck] = 0. Thus, QI measures information on a \\nlogarithmic scale that is symmetric about the natural no-information \\nmidpoint, 0. This measure is set up so that positive information favors hi over \\nhj, and negative information favors hj over \\nhi.\", \"\\nGiven the Independent Evidence Assumptions with respect to each hypothesis, it's easy to show that the QI for a sequence \\nof outcomes is just the sum of the QIs of the individual outcomes in \\nthe sequence:\", \"\\nProbability theorists measure the expected value of a \\nquantity by first multiplying each of its possible values by \\ntheir probabilities of occurring, and then summing these \\nproducts.

To the extent that members of a \\nscientific community disagree on the likelihoods, they disagree about \\nthe empirical content of their hypotheses, about what each hypothesis \\nsays about how the world is likely to be.  This can lead to \\ndisagreement about which hypotheses are refuted or supported by a given \\nbody of evidence. Similarly, to the extent that the values of \\nlikelihoods are only vaguely implied by hypotheses as understood by an individual agent, that agent may be unable \\nto determine which of several hypotheses is refuted or supported by a \\ngiven body of evidence.\", \"\\nWe have seen, however, that the values of individual likelihoods are not \\nwhat is most crucial to the way evidence impacts hypotheses.

The the proof of the \\ntheorem doesn't depend on the supposition that likelihoods are \\nobjective or have intersubjectively agreed values.

The only problem with applying this result across a \\nrange of support functions is that when their values for likelihoods differ, function \\nP\\u03b1 may disagree with P\\u03b2 on \\nwhich of the hypotheses is favored by a given sequence of evidence. That can happen because \\ndifferent support functions may represent the evidential import of hypotheses differently, by \\nspecifying different likelihood values for the very same evidence claims.  So, an evidence stream \\nthat favors hi according to \\nP\\u03b1 may instead favor hj \\naccording to P\\u03b2.  However, when the \\nDirectional Agreement Condition holds for a given collection \\nof support functions, this cannot happen. Directional Agreement \\nmeans that the evidential import of hypotheses is similar \\nenough for P\\u03b1 and P\\u03b2 \\nthat a sequence of outcomes may favor a hypothesis according to \\nP\\u03b1 only if it does so for \\nP\\u03b2 as well.\", \"\\nThus, when the Directional Agreement Condition holds for all support functions in a vagueness or diversity set extended to include vague or diverse likelihoods, if \\nenough evidentially distinguishing experiments or observations can be \\nperformed, all support functions in the extended vagueness or \\ndiversity set will very probably come to agree that the \\nlikelihood ratios for empirically distinct false competitors of a true \\nhypothesis are extremely small.

But whether in error or malice, if either of the propositions above is wrong, then a policy decision based upon it (California need never make plans to deal with a drought) probably would fail to serve the public interest.\", \"Assuming the propositions are sound, the rather stern logic of deductive reasoning can give you absolutely certain conclusions. However, deductive reasoning cannot really increase human knowledge (it is nonampliative) because the conclusions yielded by deductive reasoning are tautologies-statements that are contained within the premises and virtually self-evident. Therefore, while with deductive reasoning we can make observations and expand implications, we cannot make predictions about future or otherwise non-observed phenomena.\", \"Inductive reasoning: conclusion merely likelyInductive reasoning begins with observations that are specific and limited in scope, and proceeds to a generalized conclusion that is likely, but not certain, in light of accumulated evidence. You could say that inductive reasoning moves from the specific to the general. Much scientific research is carried out by the inductive method: gathering evidence, seeking patterns, and forming a hypothesis or theory to explain what is seen.\", \"Conclusions reached by the inductive method are not logical necessities; no amount of inductive evidence guarantees the conclusion. This is because there is no way to know that all the possible evidence has been gathered, and that there exists no further bit of unobserved evidence that might invalidate my hypothesis. Thus, while the newspapers might report the conclusions of scientific research as absolutes, scientific literature itself uses more cautious language, the language of inductively reached, probable conclusions:\", \"What we have seen is the ability of these cells to feed the blood vessels of tumors and to heal the blood vessels surrounding wounds. The findings suggest that these adult stem cells may be an ideal source of cells for clinical therapy. For example, we can envision the use of these stem cells for therapies against cancer tumors [...].1\", \"Because inductive conclusions are not logical necessities, inductive arguments are not simply true. Rather, they are cogent: that is, the evidence seems complete, relevant, and generally convincing, and the conclusion is therefore probably true. Nor are inductive arguments simply false; rather, they are not cogent.\", \"It is an important difference from deductive reasoning that, while inductive reasoning cannot yield an absolutely certain conclusion, it can actually increase human knowledge (it is ampliative). It can make predictions about future events or as-yet unobserved phenomena.\", \"For example, Albert Einstein observed the movement of a pocket compass when he was five years old and became fascinated with the idea that something invisible in the space around the compass needle was causing it to move. This observation, combined with additional observations (of moving trains, for example) and the results of logical and mathematical tools (deduction), resulted in a rule that fit his observations and could predict events that were as yet unobserved.\", \"Abductive reasoning: taking your best shotAbductive reasoning typically begins with an incomplete set of observations and proceeds to the likeliest possible explanation for the set. Abductive reasoning yields the kind of daily decision-making that does its best with the information at hand, which often is incomplete.\", \"A medical diagnosis is an application of abductive reasoning: given this set of symptoms, what is the diagnosis that would best explain most of them? Likewise, when jurors hear evidence in a criminal case, they must consider whether the prosecution or the defense has the best explanation to cover all the points of evidence. While there may be no certainty about their verdict, since there may exist additional evidence that was not admitted in the case, they make their best guess based on what they know.\", \"While cogent inductive reasoning requires that the evidence that might shed light on the subject be fairly complete, whether positive or negative, abductive reasoning is characterized by lack of completeness, either in the evidence, or in the explanation, or both. A patient may be unconscious or fail to report every symptom, for example, resulting in incomplete evidence, or a doctor may arrive at a diagnosis that fails to explain several of the symptoms. Still, he must reach the best diagnosis he can.\", \"The abductive process can be creative, intuitive, even revolutionary.2 Einstein's work, for example, was not just inductive and deductive, but involved a creative leap of imagination and visualization that scarcely seemed warranted by the mere observation of moving trains and falling elevators. In fact, so much of Einstein's work was done as a \\\"thought experiment\\\" (for he never experimentally dropped elevators), that some of his peers discredited it as too fanciful. Nevertheless, he appears to have been right-until now his remarkable conclusions about space-time continue to be verified experientially.\", \"\\u00a0\", \"References1.

While the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument may be probable, based upon the evidence given.[1]\", \"Many dictionaries define inductive reasoning as the derivation of general principles from specific observations, though some sources disagree with this usage.[2]\", \"The philosophical definition of inductive reasoning is more nuanced than simple progression from particular/individual instances to broader generalizations. Rather, the premises of an inductive logical argument indicate some degree of support (inductive probability) for the conclusion but do not entail it; that is, they suggest truth but do not ensure it. In this manner, there is the possibility of moving from general statements to individual instances (for example, statistical syllogisms, discussed below).\", \"\", \"\", \"Inductive reasoning is inherently uncertain. It only deals in degrees to which, given the premises, the conclusion is credible according to some theory of evidence. Examples include a many-valued logic, Dempster\\u2013Shafer theory, or probability theory with rules for inference such as Bayes' rule. Unlike deductive reasoning, it does not rely on universals holding over a closed domain of discourse to draw conclusions, so it can be applicable even in cases of epistemic uncertainty (technical issues with this may arise however; for example, the second axiom of probability is a closed-world assumption).[3]\", \"An example of an inductive argument:\", \"This argument could have been made every time a new biological life form was found, and would have been correct every time; however, it is still possible that in the future a biological life form not requiring liquid water could be discovered.\", \"As a result, the argument may be stated less formally as:\", \"Unlike deductive arguments, inductive reasoning allows for the possibility that the conclusion is false, even if all of the premises are true.[4] Instead of being valid or invalid, inductive arguments are either strong or weak, which describes how probable it is that the conclusion is true.[5] Another crucial difference is that deductive certainty is impossible in non-axiomatic systems, such as reality, leaving inductive reasoning as the primary route to (probabilistic) knowledge of such systems.[6]\", \"Given that \\\"if A is true then that would cause B, C, and D to be true\\\", an example of deduction would be \\\"A is true therefore we can deduce that B, C, and D are true\\\". An example of induction would be \\\"B, C, and D are observed to be true therefore A might be true\\\". A is a reasonable explanation for B, C, and D being true.\", \"For example:\", \"Note however that this is not necessarily the case. Other events also coincide with the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. For example, the Deccan Traps in India.\", \"A classical example of an incorrect inductive argument was presented by John Vickers:\", \"The definition of inductive reasoning described in this article excludes mathematical induction, which is a form of deductive reasoning that is used to strictly prove properties of recursively defined sets.[7] The deductive nature of mathematical induction is based on the non-finite number of cases involved when using mathematical induction, in contrast with the finite number of cases involved in an enumerative induction procedure with a finite number of cases like proof by exhaustion. Both mathematical induction and proof by exhaustion are examples of complete induction. Complete induction is a type of masked deductive reasoning.\", \"Inductive reasoning has been criticized by thinkers as diverse as Sextus Empiricus[8] and Karl Popper.[9]\", \"The classic philosophical treatment of the problem of induction was given by the Scottish philosopher David Hume.[10]\", \"Although the use of inductive reasoning demonstrates considerable success, its application has been questionable. Recognizing this, Hume highlighted the fact that our mind draws uncertain conclusions from relatively limited experiences. In deduction, the truth value of the conclusion is based on the truth of the premise. In induction, however, the dependence on the premise is always uncertain. As an example, let's assume \\\"all ravens are black.\\\" The fact that there are numerous black ravens supports the assumption. However, the assumption becomes inconsistent with the fact that there are white ravens. Therefore, the general rule of \\\"all ravens are black\\\" is inconsistent with the existence of the white raven. Hume further argued that it is impossible to justify inductive reasoning: specifically, that it cannot be justified deductively, so our only option is to justify it inductively. Since this is circular he concluded that our use of induction is unjustifiable with the help of Hume's Fork.[11]\", \"However, Hume then stated that even if induction were proved unreliable, we would still have to rely on it. So instead of a position of severe skepticism, Hume advocated a practical skepticism based on common sense, where the inevitability of induction is accepted.[12]\", \"Bertrand Russell illustrated his skepticism in a story about a turkey, fed every morning without fail, who following the laws of induction concludes this will continue, but then his throat is cut on Thanksgiving Day.[13]\", \"Inductive reasoning is also known as hypothesis construction because any conclusions made are based on current knowledge and predictions.[citation needed] As with deductive arguments, biases can distort the proper application of inductive argument, thereby preventing the reasoner from forming the most logical conclusion based on the clues. Examples of these biases include the availability heuristic, confirmation bias, and the predictable-world bias.\", \"The availability heuristic causes the reasoner to depend primarily upon information that is readily available to him/her. People have a tendency to rely on information that is easily accessible in the world around them. For example, in surveys, when people are asked to estimate the percentage of people who died from various causes, most respondents would choose the causes that have been most prevalent in the media such as terrorism, and murders, and airplane accidents rather than causes such as disease and traffic accidents, which have been technically \\\"less accessible\\\" to the individual since they are not emphasized as heavily in the world around him/her.\", \"The confirmation bias is based on the natural tendency to confirm rather than to deny a current hypothesis. Research has demonstrated that people are inclined to seek solutions to problems that are more consistent with known hypotheses rather than attempt to refute those hypotheses. Often, in experiments, subjects will ask questions that seek answers that fit established hypotheses, thus confirming these hypotheses. For example, if it is hypothesized that Sally is a sociable individual, subjects will naturally seek to confirm the premise by asking questions that would produce answers confirming that Sally is in fact a sociable individual.\", \"The predictable-world bias revolves around the inclination to perceive order where it has not been proved to exist, either at all or at a particular level of abstraction. Gambling, for example, is one of the most popular examples of predictable-world bias. Gamblers often begin to think that they see simple and obvious patterns in the outcomes and, therefore, believe that they are able to predict outcomes based upon what they have witnessed. In reality, however, the outcomes of these games are difficult to predict and highly complex in nature. However, in general, people tend to seek some type of simplistic order to explain or justify their beliefs and experiences, and it is often difficult for them to realise that their perceptions of order may be entirely different from the truth.[14]\", \"A generalization (more accurately, an inductive generalization) proceeds from a premise about a sample to a conclusion about the population.\", \"There are 20 balls\\u2014either black or white\\u2014in an urn. To estimate their respective numbers, you draw a sample of four balls and find that three are black and one is white. A good inductive generalization would be that there are 15 black and five white balls in the urn.\", \"How much the premises support the conclusion depends upon (a) the number in the sample group, (b) the number in the population, and (c) the degree to which the sample represents the population (which may be achieved by taking a random sample). The hasty generalization and the biased sample are generalization fallacies.\", \"A statistical syllogism proceeds from a generalization to a conclusion about an individual.\", \"The proportion in the first premise would be something like \\\"3/5ths of\\\", \\\"all\\\", \\\"few\\\", etc. Two dicto simpliciter fallacies can occur in statistical syllogisms: \\\"accident\\\" and \\\"converse accident\\\".\", \"Simple induction proceeds from a premise about a sample group to a conclusion about another individual.\", \"This is a combination of a generalization and a statistical syllogism, where the conclusion of the generalization is also the first premise of the statistical syllogism.\", \"The process of analogical inference involves noting the shared properties of two or more things, and from this basis inferring that they also share some further property:[15]\", \"Analogical reasoning is very frequent in common sense, science, philosophy and the humanities, but sometimes it is accepted only as an auxiliary method. A refined approach is case-based reasoning.[16]\", \"A causal inference draws a conclusion about a causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect. Premises about the correlation of two things can indicate a causal relationship between them, but additional factors must be confirmed to establish the exact form of the causal relationship.\", \"A prediction draws a conclusion about a future individual from a past sample.\", \"As a logic of induction rather than a theory of belief, Bayesian inference does not determine which beliefs are a priori rational, but rather determines how we should rationally change the beliefs we have when presented with evidence. We begin by committing to a prior probability for a hypothesis based on logic or previous experience, and when faced with evidence, we adjust the strength of our belief in that hypothesis in a precise manner using Bayesian logic.\", \"Around 1960, Ray Solomonoff founded the theory of universal inductive inference, the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. This is a formal inductive framework that combines algorithmic information theory with the Bayesian framework. Universal inductive inference is based on solid philosophical foundations,[17] and can be considered as a mathematically formalized Occam's razor. Fundamental ingredients of the theory are the concepts of algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity.\"]}]"}}
