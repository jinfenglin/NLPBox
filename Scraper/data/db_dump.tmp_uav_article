A more thorough approach was chosen by involving the National Aerospace Laboratory NLR. Scenarios were defined to support the Agency with the Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) of a number of UAS. The aim was to determine - by executing test flights - to what extent a specific suas type meets a requirement, and which suas performs better. This evaluation confirmed the usefulness of suas for police force activities in addition to the already available manned aeroplanes and helicopters. The manned and unmanned aircraft (systems) operated by the Dutch national police address different information needs. It is essential that information generated from air surveillance seamlessly integrates in the information systems already in use. This subject was dealt with in the Fire-Fly project, for which NLR developed the imaging system. The goal of this project was to integrate the acquired images into the command chain, instead of just presenting them to the Unmanned Aircraft s Remote Pilot. Another area of interest is the upcoming regulation for professional use of suas. It is the concern of the Dutch police force that new rules and regulations enhance safety, without unnecessary limiting suas operations. Meanwhile attention is given to all possible safety and training aspects to enable the safe operation and application of suas. NLR was asked to develop and provide a suas Remote Pilot Training. With respect to the systems themselves, technical and operational improvements are needed on several areas. Especially airworthiness qualification is considered important to enable practically unlimited operations within populated areas. Secondly, robustness, user interface and operation in stronger wind conditions are high on the police forces list of requirements. Next to the KLPD the article encompasses other Dutch police forces and the Civil Military Cooperation (CIMIC). 1. INTRODUCTION Air-to-ground surveillance systems provide a unique contribution to gain situational awareness. The overview picture that they generate, combined with their perspective from above, provides users with a context and type of information unmatched by other sources. Soon after military UAS operations started, these systems attracted the attention of the Dutch police forces. The Netherlands Police Agency (KLPD) started experimenting with Unmanned Aircraft Systems in 2007 and since then investigated the application of these aircraft for a diversity of police force specific scenarios. The activities started by simply acquiring an unmanned helicopter, but rapidly evolved into a more thorough approach including the involvement of the National Aerospace Laboratory NLR. Also the 1 Paper presented at the UAS 2011 conference, organised by UVS International, in Paris, France, June /9\", \"6 Universities of Delft and Wageningen were contacted for cooperation. Trials were set up to obtain more insight in the possibilities and applicability of the different systems. Scenarios were defined and tested. This confirmed the usefulness of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for police force activities in addition to the already available manned aircraft. With respect to the systems themselves, technical and operational improvements are needed on several areas, of which the airworthiness qualification is the most important from a safety point of view. The Remote Pilot Station is probably one of the most urgent from a user s perspective. Another important area of interest is the upcoming regulation for professional use of UAS. It is the concern of the Dutch police force that the rules and regulations might limit their UAS operations. Meanwhile attention is given to all possible safety and training aspects to enable the safe operation and application of small UAS (0 < Maximum Take-off Mass < 150 kg). Next to the KLPD activities, this paper includes activities performed by the regional police force of Amsterdam-Amstelland and the Program Against Organized Crime And Cannabis Cultivation. 2. SMALL UAS USED The Dutch police forces use several small UAS, either owned by the KLPD and the regional police force Amsterdam-Amstelland, or under support from the Ministry of Defence. Within the Program Against Organized Crime And Cannabis Cultivation experiments were performed with a rented small unmanned rotorcraft for the fight against narcotics. The UAS used and some examples of their application are described below. The main specifications are presented in table 1. Table 1.

The main applications for these UAS are obtaining a better situational awareness by getting a bird s eye view and mapping of the crime scene. The RH2a is used more often in harsh environments like the higher wind speeds and whenever a longer endurance is required. The Falcon 8 is used more often in close range, quick response, waypoint navigation and short endurance circumstances. The Falcon 8 can be deployed faster than the RH2a. The Raven B is used for special circumstances in which the small unmanned rotorcraft capabilities do not satisfy the required operation. The Raven B is operated by the Ministry of Defence in separated airspace (e.g. special rules area or parts of a control zone, CTR). Delft Dynamics RH2a The RH2a system consists of a helicopter with camera or other sensor(s) and a Remote Pilot Station from which the Remote Pilot controls and monitors the helicopter. The helicopter is equipped with sensors and a computer system that provide flight stabilisation and control. 4 2/9\", \"7 AscTec Falcon 8 The Falcon 8 is equipped with 8 rotors and able to maintain high levels of flight stability in wind speeds up to 10 m/s. If one of the rotor/motor combinations fails in flight, it is still able to continue flying with maximum payload and strong winds. As soon as a GPS signal is established the Falcon 8 is able to hold its position. By using the waypoint planning software a mission can be planed, before and during the flight. The system can also be controlled by the Remote Pilot using the life video feed. The V-layout of the Falcon 8 enables the camera to be faced completely down, horizontal and completely up without any of the rotors blocking the image. AeroVironment Raven B The Raven B is a lightweight fixed wing unmanned aircraft suitable for rapid deployment and low-altitude surveillance and reconnaissance. The system can be piloted manually or programmed for automatic operation, utilizing the system's advanced avionics and precise GPS navigation. The hand-launched Raven B provides aerial observation, day or night, at line-of-sight ranges up to 10 kilometres. 2.2 Amsterdam-Amstelland Police Force Amsterdam-Amstelland police force uses one AirRobot AR-100 UAS. Similar to the UAS used by the KLPD, the main objectives for operating this UAS are better situational awareness and crime scene mapping. The AR-100 has been used successfully during clearance of squatter s actions and multiple mappings of accident and crime scenes. AirRobot AR-100 The AirRobot is equipped with 4 rotors and allows for autonomous stable hands-off, hover operation using GPS. The unit is further stabilized with a combination of gyroscopic, barometric and magnetic sensors. The AR 100 can maintain its position, direction and flight altitude without operator interference. It can be controlled by the Remote Pilot using a life video feed. The unit does not have to be in sight, this way the unit is flown like the operator is sitting in it. All moving parts are protected by a ring, which avoids damage to the rotors in case of an unintended collision. 2.3 Program Against Organized Crime And Cannabis Cultivation Within this program a rented Suave 7 unmanned helicopter was deployed successfully in April 2009 in the battle against the illegal growth of cannabis. This program against organized crime and cannabis cultivation was already successful on the first day the helicopter was deployed, detecting several cultivation locations. The unmanned helicopter became well known under the name CannaChopper due to abundant media attention. CannaChopper Suave 7 The Suave 7 can hover or fly pre-planned routes for several hours. The Remote Pilot can fly it by remote control or use the automatic way-point navigation system. The onboard equipment consists of a high quality digital camera and a heat sensing camera. Additionally, this aerial observation tool is equipped with the cannabis sniffer, a sensor used for the intake of air samples, to instantly recognise particles indicating the presence of cannabis. 5 3/9\", \"8 3. EVALUATION AND IDENTIFIED SCENARIOS In 2009 the KLPD initiated a project to determine the operational usefulness of different types of aerial surveillance systems, for example helicopters, fixed wing aircraft and a balloon. The National Aerospace Laboratory NLR, due to its experience with testing of small UAS for the Netherlands Defence, was asked to support the KLPD with the Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) of a number of UAS. Several police units drafted scenarios based on their tasks to describe the possible employment of UAS systems. These scenarios were used to capture the operational requirements for UAS. From these requirements, scenario independent test flights were developed. The aim was that by executing these test flights it could be determined to what extent a specific UAS type meets a requirement and if possible which UAS performs better or worse. The scenarios and defined tests are presented in table 2. The tests can be executed independent from each other and can also be used for training the UAS Remote Pilots to gain operational experience.

AIR SURVEILLANCE MEANS The KLPD operates both manned as well as Unmanned Aircraft Systems with surveillance capabilities. These aircraft address different information needs through their differences in flight endurance, visibility, payload capacity etc. UAS play a complementary role with respect to manned aircraft and can not be just seen as competitors. Each means for air surveillance has its own specific advantages and disadvantages. Table 3 presents an overview as identified by the KLPD. 6 4/9\", \"9 Table 3.

Graphical presentation of the available surveillance means characteristics. 7 5/9\", \"10 5 INFORMATION INTEGRATION Although the availability of air-to-ground surveillance means already provides a unique contribution to building up situational awareness, the presentation to the right police officers combined with the required meta data completes the overview picture and provides users with a context and type of information unmatched by other sources. Therefore, it is essential that sensors sensors collection processing & processing & analysis analysis users information information products products networked networked databases & tools databases & tools networked enabled operations information generated from air surveillance should seamlessly integrate in the information systems already in use. This integration aspect is often undervalued. As mentioned, the manned and unmanned aircraft (systems) operated by the Dutch national police address different information needs. However, the integration issue with information is largely comparable. Technical and operational challenges remain and new challenges arise in efforts to maximise the operational and economical benefit of air-to-ground surveillance systems. Figure 2. National helicopter aerial video network. A ground station network national (Netherlands) coverage is being installed for wireless data transmission between the (manned) helicopters and the users on the ground, see figure 2. The smaller UAS require a different integration, as these act in tactical operations and require local control. In this respect, a project should be mentioned that focused on the issue of information integration, and which was closely followed by the Netherlands Police Agency, the so called Fire-Fly project. 5.1 The Fire-Fly project In the Fire-Fly project, NLR was asked by the fire brigade of the North and East Gelderland safety domain to research the possibility of deploying a small, unmanned flying observation system to supplement existing fire-fighting equipment. The goal of the project was to offer chief fire fighting 8 6/9\", \"11 officers a real-time overview of the fire area by sending the obtained aerial images to a crisis centre as well as the police, other fire brigades and fire fighters in the field, allowing them to tackle the fire more effectively. NLR was in charge of the technological development of the imaging system, including system design, the processing of video images, and the storage of data and visual images. Tests were conducted with the Delft Dynamics unmanned helicopter in 2010, transmitting the first metadata images to the fire brigade s crisis management system, where all data are gathered. In collaboration with the Amsterdam-Amstelland fire brigade, video images were acquired by the UAS for use during an exercise. During the end demonstration on 11 may 2011, live images were sent directly to the fire brigade s crisis management system, without intermediate steps. The images were gathered by two Unmanned Aircraft, the Delft Dynamics Robot helicopter, and the AeroVironment Puma AE and successfully fed into the crisis management system. NLR conducted the Fire-Fly project in cooperation with the fire brigade of the North and East Gelderland safety domain as well as the industrial partners Nieuwland Automation, Geodan Systems & Research and Delft Dynamics. The project was part of the Safety chapter of the Dutch government s Social Innovation Agenda, which in turn is part of a broader government programme stimulating entrepreneurship in innovation in the Netherlands. NLR research activities are ongoing, linking the NLR s Quadcopter via a Remote Pilot Station interface provided by NLR s Multi-UAS Supervision Testbed (MUST). The video images and data traffic will subsequently be processed and modified to offer the required overview to the end users. 6. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS Currently small UAS air regulations in The Netherlands are under development and therefore all Police Force small UAS operations are currently being performed under the Model Flying Regulations. This limits the use of UAS to those aircraft with a maximum take-off mass below 25 kg (including fuel and payload). Additionally, the main requirement is that the operation of the aircraft may not endanger any person or property on the ground nor other airspace users. To meet the first part of this requirement, the area of operation can be closed to the public. The regulations limit operations to a maximum operating height above ground level of 300 meters in class G airspace. Operations in class C airspace have been arranged with local ATC in a covenant. To ensure public safety, the Minister of Transport can close or restrict parts of the airspace temporarily upon request of the local authorities. In practice, small unmanned rotorcraft are typically operated between 15 and 70 meter above ground level and the fixed wing aircraft (Raven B) is operated between 120 and 180 meter above mean sea level in separated airspace (day and night). All civil operations must be performed within Visual Line Of Sight (VLOS) of the Remote Pilot. The main limiting factors experienced for Police force operations are the prohibited (civil) operations beyond VLOS and at night. Another limiting factor is the maximum wind speed in which the UAS can be operated. The average wind speed in The Netherlands is more than 4 bft for over 45% of the time throughout the year. 7. UAS REMOTE PILOTS TRAINING To enhance safe operations, a need for a more thorough technical and theoretical background was recognised and NLR was asked by the KLPD to develop a UAS Remote Pilots Training. Since the legislative framework for UAS operations was lacking in the Netherlands, there were also no legal requirements for crew training and licensing. NLR already wrote a training plan for the training of it s own Facility for Unmanned Rotorcraft Research (FURORE) UAS Remote Pilots, which was approved 9 7/9\", \"12 by the Netherlands Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA) until legislation is introduced. This training plan, derived from Private Pilot Licence learning objectives, was further adjusted on the basis of available information on regulations under development in this area. Objective of the Remote Pilots Training is the proper, safe and with understanding operation of a Small Unmanned Rotorcraft System in the Netherlands for police tasks. The following general aviation theory subjects, adjusted for Small UAS operations, are included in the training: UAS General knowledge Principles of flight Flight performance and planning Air law Meteorology Human performance and limitations Navigation Operational procedures. NLR prepared a training programme of two days in which practical simulation training is included upon request of the National Police Agency. The students are provided with a syllabus and tested on the knowledge gained. This multidisciplinary training is the result of close cooperation between several NLR departments with knowledge on (rotorcraft) UAS, Human Performance, and UAS operations. The training was first given March 2010 at NLR and attended by UAS Remote Pilots from multiple Police forces. 8. COOPERATION In carrying out a large number of police tasks an increasing need for air surveillance is identified. Some (regional) police forces have already purchased some smaller UAS and gained experience with the technology and operational use. The KLPD has set a goal to support various police forces by the implementation of UAS. Co-operation with military forces has been established and the cooperation with emergency services like fire brigades is expected to follow soon. The support of police tasks by the Ministry of Defence has been agreed between the Ministries of Interior and Defence. The agreement defines when and where the Ministry of Defence supports civil authorities. Such a commitment is always at the request of and under the leadership of the civil authorities. RoboSwift The KLPD supports the development of the RoboSwift, a micro airplane fitted with movable wings, inspired by the common Swift, under development at the University of Wageningen and the Technical University of Delft. Together with the Technical University of Delft the EMAV 2009 conference was organised and sponsored with equipment and personnel. Currently the IMAV 2011 conference is being organised, which will also be sponsored as well as provided with a price for the best user deployable UAS. 10 8/9\", \"13 9. UAS IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED Main focus within the Dutch police is the tactical deployment of UAS. The goal is to obtain information through (remote) sensing at difficult and/or dangerous locations. The operational experience and use of UAS learned that the currently available UAS still have limitations, but can become a powerful tool. Improvements of the current systems are necessary on: Airworthiness qualification; Robustness; Operation in stronger wind conditions; User interface (control logic); Data transfer to command station in a secure network; Mobility (by one person); Sensor quality; Especially airworthiness qualification is considered important to enable practically unlimited operations, also within populated areas. Secondly robustness, user interface and operation in stronger wind conditions are high on the police forces list of requirements. 10. CONCLUSIONS The Netherlands Police Agency (KLPD) recognised the added value of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for a diversity of police force specific scenarios. The police forces in the Netherlands operate with several unmanned rotorcraft systems in the Maximum Take-Off Mass range below 25 kg, among which are: the Delft Dynamics RH2a, the AscTec Falcon 8, and the AirRobot AR-100. A fixed wing system (AeroVironment Raven B) operated by the Ministry of Defence is available for support of police tasks through an agreement between the Ministries of Interior and Defence. An overview is given of the available air surveillance means available to the police force. The use of UAS clearly has an additional value next to, thus not replacing, manned aviation for police tasks. The (initial) activities lead to the involvement of the National Aerospace Laboratory NLR for technical and operational support. Among these activities are: Trials to obtain more insight in the possibilities and applicability of different systems; Definition and testing of police task scenarios, confirming the usefulness of UAS for police tasks; Information integration of the acquired images into the command chain (Fire-Fly project); Development and providing a UAS Remote Pilot Training. For Police force operations some limiting factors are experienced. These are the: Prohibited (civil) operations beyond VLOS and at night; Maximum wind speed in which the UAS can be operated. With respect to the unmanned systems, the following technical improvements are high on the police forces whish list: Airworthiness qualification; Robustness; User interface; Less sensitive to (cross-)wind. The airworthiness qualification is important both from a viewpoint of safety and to enable unlimited operations within populated areas. The police forces are continually looking for cooperation with other technologically advanced parties for further improvement of their systems and keeping a forefront position with up-to-date technical equipment. 11 9/9\", \"\\n        \\n        AeroVironment, Inc.

'With its endurance and quick deployment ability, Indago can be used for tasks ranging from surveillance to supporting firefighting operations to search and rescue.'\\n\", \"\\nIndago's infrared system, called Noctis, consists of dual FLIR infrared cameras that provide real time streaming video and still imagery. Noctis uses wide and narrow fields of view with a digital zoom field of view from 32 degrees to 2 degrees, with seamless transition between cameras. Its vision processing provides feature tracking of objects, reducing operator workload. Noctis is offered in two variants, laser equipped, or non-laser equipped.\\n\", \"\\nThe Indago 3 quadrotor UAS weighs less than five pounds and can be airborne in less than three minutes. Along with a low acoustic and visual signature during startup and flight, the platform's haze grey color minimizes visual detection during missions. Depending on payloads, Indago 3 can fly up to 50 minutes at a cruise speed of 25 mph and can operate at temperatures as low as 30-degrees below zero, and as high as 120 degrees.\\n\", \"\\nFor more information about Indago, visit: https://www.lockheedmartin.com/indago.

(NNS) -- The RQ-21A Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (STUAS) completed its first East Coast flight from Webster Field Annex on June 12, marking the start of the next phase of test for the program.\\n\\nA team from the Navy and Marine Corps STUAS program office (PMA-263) here and industry partner Insitu, Inc., are conducting flight operations at Webster, NAS Pax River's outlying field, this June in preparation for Integrated Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in the fall.\\n\\nDuring the June 12 flight, Insitu operators launched the unmanned aircraft using a pneumatic launcher, eliminating the need for a runway. The RQ-21A was recovered after a 1.8 hour flight, using a company-built system known as the STUAS Recovery System (SRS). The system enables a safe recovery and expeditionary capability for tactical UAS on land or at sea.\\n\\n \\\"This test period brings us closer to providing our warfighter with a unique capability - an indigenous UAS capable of operations from both land and sea,\\\" said U.S. Marine Corps Col. Jim Rector, PMA-263 program manager. \\\"The expeditionary nature of the RQ-21A makes it possible to deploy a multi-intelligence capable UAS with minimal footprint.\\\"\\n\\nThe current phase of testing is intended to validate updates that have been made to the system in the past several months, which include software, fuselage and camera enhancements. The conditions at Webster Field also allow the team to test aircraft performance points at lower density altitudes, said Greg Oliver, the program's lead test engineer.\\n\\nIn 2012, the small unmanned aircraft completed land-based testing in China Lake, Calif., and began ship-based developmental tests aboard USS Mesa Verde (LPD 19) in February. After this test phase is complete, the team will transport the system, which includes a ground control station and three air vehicles, back to Norfolk, Va., to embark LPD 19  for shipboard flight testing in July.\\n\\nIOT&E will begin in October at Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command (MCAGCC) Twentynine Palms, Calif. Ship-based IOT&E is scheduled for December in preparation for the system's initial deployment in 2014.\\n\\nThe RQ-21A platform is designed to fill a need for the Marine Expeditionary Forces, Navy L-Class ships, and Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Units. When deployed, it will provide a 24/7 maritime and land-based tactical reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition data collection and dissemination capabilities to the warfighter.\\n\",

They prefer remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). If you're puzzled at their sensitivity to semantics, you might want to remember that the word \\\"drone\\\" connotes an entirely automated experience, when in fact the pilots \\u2014 and sensor operators and intelligence analysts \\u2014 play an integral part in making the drone a functional piece of machinery [source: Hurwitz]. Piloting a drone goes beyond using a joystick and pressing the red button, in other words \\u2014 even if that's precisely the setup.\", \"Which leads us to the topic: How different is flying a drone from playing a video game? And is RPA pilot training that different from a 15-year-old boy's average Friday night? The first question is \\u2014 predictably \\u2014 a mess of conflicting opinions. For good reason, some drone pilots might take umbrage to comparisons of their job \\u2014 which can involve actually killing human beings \\u2014 to a video game [source: Blackhurst]. On the other hand, a study conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed that video game players were uniquely suited to drone operation due to their increased attention to multiple details at a time [source: Canadian Press].\", \"As for training, don't expect drone pilots to have a bullet point on their resume that reads, \\\"I sat in my mother's basement and logged 170 hours beating 'Aerial Force Strike.'\\\" In fact, a lot of pilots have been recruited out of actual military flying programs, where they were logging time piloting real manned aircraft [source: Hurwitz]. There doesn't seem to be much evidence that the military is actively providing video games for training, but anecdotal stories abound about drone pilots who seemingly perform better because of their gaming experience [source: Democracy Now].\", \"One piece that does get mentioned quite a bit? Video games \\u2014 while providing a fairly decent simulation or at least being capable of fine-tuning hand-eye coordination \\u2014 aren't going to give the drone pilots one real-life experience that's pretty intrinsic to their daily routine: boredom. While you may think of piloting an unmanned aerial vehicle as one heart-racing moment after the other, a lot of the job is simply sitting around, watching a target. If someone asks you to collect intelligence on a certain spot or person, you might spend weeks simply flying in circles, recording the mundane life that is unfurling \\u2014 or totally absent \\u2014 in the little spot you're watching [source: Hurwitz].\", \"It's actually quite different from a video game, where nonstop action leads players to keep pushing for their adrenaline rush. However, a video game player might be better suited to it than \\u2014 say \\u2014 an Air Force or Marine pilot who has been trained for action and now is forced to sit in a chair all day and scour the same countryside for hours at a time [source: Breeden].

Her back was turned for a moment, but it was just long enough for her kids to disappear out of sight deep into the park. Officers arrive and prepare their DJI Mavic Pro unmanned aircraft system (UAS) for deployment. Within moments, the drone is airborne.\", \"It covers acres of land in a matter of minutes, as two officers act as drone and camera operators. Their task is to spot any sign of the two children. A red jacket is spotted briefly in the dense brush. Changing the camera to an infrared sensor, the officer spots the heat signature of two children crouched in the bushes. With the drone's exact location highlighted on a moving map, rescuers make their way to the two lost children and reunite the family less than 20 minutes after beginning their response.\", \"As technology progresses, so too must the tactics used by law enforcement. Many times, this involves purchasing new equipment, conducting additional training, and revising departmental policy. Without exception, the addition of a drone program requires an adjustment within the organization as a whole. In the simplest of terms, the drone must be purchased through the appropriate requisition process, officers must be trained on an extensive list of constitutional, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and an acceptable drone usage policy must be drafted to remain transparent with the community to mitigate privacy protection concerns.\", \"Photo: Michael Hamann\", \"Prior to deciding on whether to purchase an unmanned drone vs. a manned fixed-wing aircraft or helicopter, it is important to realize that these machines serve entirely different purposes.\", \"Drones are ideally utilized as tools for searches (especially where danger exists for humans), collecting reconnaissance data, photographing crime scenes, and limited-scope short-term surveillance.\", \"Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are better suited for in-progress crime monitoring (such as pursuits and robberies), long-term surveillance, and routine patrol operations. Additionally, a helicopter's flight crew is capable of rapidly responding to an incident from a distance and providing back-up or first aid, while a drone must be deployed near the scene. Think of adding a drone to the department as a supplemental force multiplier, rather than a replacement for an air asset.\", \"Once you've determined that your agency's missions can benefit from a drone program, you have to get permission from the feds to operate a UAS.\", \"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has two authorization processes available to law enforcement agencies operating drones as public aircraft (as defined by 49 USC \\u00a740102(a)(41)).\", \"Remote Pilot Certification Requirements Under 14 CFR \\u00a7107\", \"While two processes are available, they cannot be intermingled. The agency applying for authorization must choose one or the other, and must operate under the restrictions applied to all publicly owned aircraft.\", \"The first authorization available to public aircraft requires more initial work on behalf of the applying law enforcement agency, but grants better access to airspace and reduces the amount of subsequent coordination. The Certificate of Authorization (COA) process outlines an agency's plan of operation in great detail.\", \"The COA requires the applying agency to thoroughly document and self-certify their drones, pilots, and intended locations of operation. Because the law enforcement applicant certifies his or her own drone, the size and weight of the drone is subject to the agency's discretion, not statutory limitations. Depending on the type of airspace in which the agency intends to operate, a blanket approval or site-specific agreement is issued.\", \"The FAA enacted new regulations under 14 CFR \\u00a7107 (better known as \\\"Part 107\\\") to enable civilly owned drone aircraft to operate within controlled airspace with their own set of restrictions. Initially, the Part 107 exemption requires less work when compared to the COA process. Drones operated under Part 107 must weigh less than 55 pounds and be registered as aircraft. Operators of the drone must be certified as remote pilot operators with a small UAS rating. Once this process is complete, the agency is permitted to operate its drone in accordance with the provisions of Part 107, including obtaining instant airspace waivers through the future Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) program.\", \"An officer is using a DJI Cendence controller with a DJI CrystalSky monitor to operate his agency's UAS, or drone. Photo: Michael Hamann\", \"The main benefit to operating a drone in law enforcement operations is the per-hour cost basis vs. manned aerial assets. While drones are not intended to replace manned aerial assets, they can supplement certain operations for less cost while simultaneously relieving manned aerial assets from those tasks so they can perform other missions.\", \"A simple cost comparison between drones and helicopters shows a significant amount of savings for the department if it uses drones instead of helicopters for some missions. The Tulsa (Okla.) Police Department purchased a new Eurocopter AS350B2 in 2013 with an estimated price tag of $2.5 million, including\\u00a0 aftermarket law enforcement upgrades. Assuming pilot training was conducted through an independent flight school, the cost of training one pilot to become pilot-in-command of the helicopter is at minimum $43,000.\", \"Those are just the introductory costs of fielding a manned aerial asset; the annual cost of a helicopter continues to have a significant impact on the department's budget. The Long Beach (Calif.) Police Department, which also operates the Eurocopter AS350B2, estimates an hourly cost of $600 per hour, exclusive of pilot salary. While excluding pilot pay, training, fuel, and extraneous expenses related to irregular maintenance, the Long Beach Police Department estimates they operate their helicopter around 650 hours per year, spending nearly $414,000 annually.\", \"The Mesa County (Colo.) Sheriff's Office was one of the early pioneers in drone usage in law enforcement and operates Dragan's Draganflyer X6 drone. Initially purchased directly from the manufacturer, the Draganflyer X6 bore a retail price of $25,000. Hourly, the Mesa County Sheriff's Office estimates the cost of operating its drone to be around $25, exclusive of pilot pay. The bulk of this cost, the Mesa County Sheriff's Office says, goes toward purchasing long-term items such as replacement propellers and batteries. Annually, these operations would cost around $10,000 if they flew for nearly 400 hours.\", \"With regards to pilot training, operating a drone is less restrictive, requiring less mandatory flight instruction. Accordingly, pilot training is typically factored into the purchase price of a drone by the manufacturer. This training can range from $1,000 to $3,000, depending on the type of drone and the extent of the training required. Additionally, operating as the pilot-in-command of a helicopter while earning compensation requires an expensive commercial pilot's license. Operating as pilot-in-command of a drone while earning compensation only requires a Remote Pilot Certificate. While the commercial pilot's license for a helicopter can cost tens of thousands of dollars, the exam for the Remote Pilot's Certificate costs $150.\", \"Photo: Michael Hamann\", \"Unmanned aerial systems offer many benefits for law enforcement operations. Unfortunately, drones can also be used against law enforcement.\", \"Drones can be used by the bad guys to monitor drug grows, surveil police officers, and transport contraband over borders and cell phones and drugs into prisons and jails. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has even warned that drones could be used in a terror attack.\", \"Such concerns have given rise to the development of counter-drone techniques and tactics for law enforcement and corrections agencies.\", \"One company that works with law enforcement on drone-use and counter-drone strategy is redUAS. Maryland-based redUAS helps agencies develop tactics and policies for utilizing drones to achieve their missions and for deterring and defeating malicious drones. The company says it trains teams to best utilize drones and counter-drone systems to increase security for vulnerable infrastructure, as well as high-value and soft targets like large public venues.\", \"\\\"Our team effectively bridges the gap between technology and employment, a key factor in making security and first responder organizations more effective,\\\" says Chris Sacco, managing partner of redUAS.\", \"The company says the need for counter-drone operations is growing. The world's largest boat show was held in November in Fort Lauderdale, FL, and over the course of that event, more than 20 unauthorized drones were intercepted by redUAS operators, the company says. RedUAS operators have an in-depth understanding of both FAA regulations concerning drones and defensive flight tactics used by the military.\", \"\\\"The boat show proved a concept that could become integral to large public events going forward. It's not a leap to expect that soon public events and sensitive geographic areas like prisons and critical infrastructure will be dealing with much more malicious threats from UAS. In fact, last month a drone was flown over an NFL game, dropping leaflets. If the operator had lost control over the crowded stands, or had been dropping something more hazardous, there would have been casualties,\\\" the company says. \\u2014 David Griffith, POLICE Magazine Editor\", \"The capabilities of the onboard technology attached to many drones presently in use by law enforcement exemplifies their utility in many applications. Operating a pair of DJI Inspire 1 drones, the Salt River (Ariz.) Police Department is capable of a variety of tasks using the onboard DJI Zenmuse X5 camera. The three-axis gimbal on the camera allows the drone's camera operator to move video in any direction in resolution as high as 4K clarity.\", \"Camera aficionados will appreciate the flexibility of the Zenmuse X5's ISO range of 100-25600, allowing for clear video during bright and low-light operations. By attaching the Zenmuse XT Integrated Thermal Camera, the camera operator can search a large field for heat signatures with similar clarity and definition as the FLIR cameras attached to most patrol helicopters.\", \"In addition to the drone's onboard systems, a suite of software increases the utility of the drone exponentially. Using photo data from the drone's high-definition camera, crime scene software such as Maxsur's PIX4D Multi-Dimensional Aerial Mapping Software is capable of rendering a complete three-dimensional picture of a crime scene. Cross-referencing the drone's location by GPS, Maxsur's software directs the drone into an automatic grid-search pattern. Maxsur boasts their software's ability to measure any angle down to 5mm once the high-definition photos have been rendered and compiled.\", \"Operating a helicopter for the purposes of photographing a crime scene can be costly, considering the high per-hour cost of a helicopter. When time is of the essence, such as when emergency responders are trying to rapidly open a road following a traffic collision, the deployment of a drone can save a significant amount of time and money while photographing the scene.\", \"Logistically speaking, the addition of a drone to your department is based entirely on justifying the need to evolve your department's technology over time. Drone programs have become increasingly fitting for large metropolitan agencies to small township police departments. As previously mentioned, drones are not intended to replace manned aviation assets. However, on a case-by-case basis, a department can save money over time by establishing a drone program that fits their need.\", \"Michael Hamann is a full-time Federal Aviation Administration employee.

Such blurred boundaries pave the way for a wholesale\\r\\nmilitarisation of the civilian domain.\", \" RAF MQ-9 Reaper, Afghanistan. Wikimedia Commons/Steve Follow. Some rights reserved.The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a technology that begs an unusually\\nlarge number of categorical ambiguities. The origin of its common name, \\u2018drone\\u2019,\\nis seemingly self-evident: it is logical to make a connection between the\\nmusical drone and the low hum of a jet engine. This is not, however, the true\\netymology. Instead, the name \\u2018drone\\u2019 derives from that of the male honey bee, a\\nbee that, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, \\u201cdoes no work but can\\nfertilise the queen\\u201d, and which shares the black abdominal stripes used to\\ndistinguish the first UAVs. And yet, the bee also buzzes, its wings whirr.\\nRegardless of the intended meaning, the UAV both is\\u00a0and does\\u00a0drone.\", \"More than a conventional fighter jet, the experience of the drone \\u2013 for\\nthose who, as a result of military campaigns waged predominantly by the US (in\\nAfghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia) and Israel (in Gaza), spend much of\\ntheir lives with UAVs loitering in the skies above \\u2013 is one characterised by\\nthe low, continuous thrum laden with the imminent potential for destruction and\\ndeath.\", \"If the lesson of this first phenomenon is to accept that it is the very\\nnature of language to collide, for its words to flow into one another, throwing\\nforth unforeseen meanings, then it is the lesson of a second similar blurring\\nthat at times such unintended consequences must be resisted in spite of their\\ninevitability.\", \"Here I am talking of the softening of the boundary between two realms in\\nwhich the UAV is used: what are usually termed the \\u2018military\\u2019 and the\\n\\u2018civilian\\u2019 domains. Since 1995, when it flew the GNAT-750 surveillance drone\\nover Bosnia, the CIA has used military drones as a tool of surveillance; since\\n2002, when the first CIA drone strike was conducted by an MQ-1 Predator on a\\n\\u2018tall man\\u2019 in Afghanistan \\u2013 believed to be Osama bin Laden, but in actual fact\\none of a group of innocent civilians collecting scrap metal \\u2013 these drones have\\nheld lethal potential.\", \"The \\u2018civilian\\u2019 drone, on the other hand, possesses a somewhat rosier\\ncomplexion. Over the last few years, there have been a flurry of stories in\\nwhich the drone is an agent of environmentalism or humanitarianism, guarding\\nagainst rhino poachers,\\u00a0helping farmers to spray their crops,\\u00a0bearing witness to nuclear disaster, and\\u00a0leading the search for the Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped\\nby Boko Haram.\\u00a0\", \"The problem is that such positive narratives concerning civilian use\\noften begin from the familiar ground of the military drone. Many of these\\narticles carry the image of the MQ-1 Predator, which has become a sort of\\nhabitual mode of advertising, playing on a combination of brand loyalty and\\nshock tactics to capture the attention of the potential reader. Or else the kind\\ncivilian drone is introduced by way of its troubled former self, constructing a\\nredemptive narrative.\", \"In the BBC\\npiece on agricultural use for instance, an upbeat tone accompanies the notion\\nthat the drone is moving \\u2018from battlefield to farm\\u2019. Yet the dangerous reality\\nis that, by viewing the drone as a singular technology, it is only our gaze\\nthat shifts from fields of destruction to those of production. The military UAV\\nitself remains and continues to kill unabated. As\\nSteven Poole has it, the personality of the drone appears split between two\\npoles: \\u201cassassination or conservation\\u201d. The technology\\u2019s\\nambiguous media presence allows for the mutual contamination of these poles,\\nfacilitating a normalization of\\u00a0\\u2018that\\nwhich destroys life\\u2019\\u00a0via the benign discourse of\\u00a0\\u2018that which saves it\\u2019.\", \"If we are not cautious of this contagion, the ramifications will be more\\nthan merely theoretical. If the discourses are blurred, the physical uses\\nthemselves will not lag far behind in being conflated. Already, it is the nature\\nof contemporary \\u2018hybrid\\u2019 or \\u2018non-linear\\u2019 warfare for conflict to merge with the\\nsphere of everyday governance, functioning through a collage of previously\\ndistinct agencies. Armies are no longer self-contained instruments, but are\\nincreasingly made up of, and used in coordination with, a milieu of special\\nforces, police, intelligence, humanitarian NGOs, diplomats, media, and, last\\nbut certainly not least, civilian populations themselves. \", \"Especially in the call and response of terrorism and counterterrorism, a\\nsoldier\\u2019s battlefield might be their own streets, and a policeman\\u2019s beat a\\nforeign port; the soldier is trained to govern, while the policeman wields a\\ngun; journalists render pens and cameras into weapons on the front line, and,\\nas we have recently been made aware, come to be targeted like soldiers\\nthemselves.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"By virtue of its development through America\\u2019s covert wars, the moral\\nlegitimacy of the military drone has always been dubious, and now the civilian\\ndrone, adopted by police forces to\\u00a0catch criminals\\u00a0and\\u00a0patrol borders, is edging too into murky\\nwaters. How long before these civilian technologies are weaponised? How long,\\ntoo, before the affordability of small drones makes them the perfect vehicles\\nfor miniature explosives devices? In the sense that it implicitly accepts these\\ntransgressions, the current doublespeak paves the way for a wholesale militarisation\\nof the civilian domain. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"The aim of separating the two meanings is not, however, to once and for\\nall clear the conscience of the civilian drone, determining it as innocent,\\nwhile the military drone remains (potentially) guilty.

But no matter how flashy, good technology should still solve concrete problems. Amid the hype of getting packages and pizzas delivered in half the time, what if drones could revolutionize transportation networks, connecting people to what they actually need the most?\", \"The health of a community relies on efficient networks. Medicine and medical supplies need to be transported reliably from Point A to Point B. This, in turn, relies on roads to travel on. Sturdy roads, able to endure heavy rains and bad weather, are something many in developed countries take for granted. But worldwide, a staggering one billion people lack access to all-season roads. What that means for people who live in remote villages: a simple rainstorm can turn a dirt road into a muddy and impassable mess, cutting them off from vital goods, services and medicines.\", \"A surprising new technology might make a difference. Andreas Raptopoulos (watch his TED Talk) and Paola Santana co-founded Matternet, a company that adds smart software to nimble drones. Their signature product, Matternet ONE, can carry 1 kilogram of cargo over 15-20 kilometers on a single battery charge.\", \"Matternet has worked with WHO in Bhutan to deliver medical supplies to remote hospitals, and with MSF (Doctors Without Borders) in Papua New Guinea to transport medical tests for tuberculosis.\", \"In March 2016, Matternet started tests, along with UNICEF, in Malawi to see how well drones could deliver medical tests and blood samples from remote villages to labs. They\\u2019re working with the Malawian government to see if the drones could reduce the wait times for HIV test results, specifically for infants.\", \"Local children watch the test flights in Katete. Photo: Aris Messinis for Matternet\", \"An estimated one million people in Malawi live with the disease, as of 2014. Testing \\u2014 and regular medication \\u2014 is crucial to survival, and yet it takes an average of 11 days to deliver supplies from health centers to labs and eight weeks to return test results. Also, according to Raptopoulos, \\u201cMore than three-quarters of them are within 20 kilometers of each other or a diagnostic lab.\\u201d Using drones could dramatically speed up this process and solve the problem of distance.\", \"The first step to solving a problem is assessing what\\u2019s already happening. Paola Santana, who is also the Head of Network Operations and Lead Coordinator for this project, studied Malawi\\u2019s current system for transporting HIV tests. \\u201cThere is someone on a motorcycle or in a car that does a circuit every day. They need to go and select the number of labs where they start in the morning, and by the afternoon, they have picked up all of these samples from these clinics. Then they go to the hospital where these samples are going to be analyzed,\\u201d she says. The problem is, though, that these routes are outdated. \\u201cThese circuits have been created based on data that has been there for a while. So imagine that as populations shift, more people now live in other areas that are not being served every day. Still, the logistics circuit stays the same.\\u201d\", \"Young girls watch test flights at the Area 18 Health Center. Photo: Aris Messinis for Matternet\", \"Logistics, she says, need to account for how people are moving, how outbreaks are spreading and how many samples are transported in real time. That way, a regular and efficient system is created, one that can transport tests once a day, as opposed to once a week or even twice a month, which is the current norm. \", \"With this data, Santana and her team clearly understood the task at hand. \\u201cThe challenge is trying to envision how the system should work that has nothing to do with how the system works today.

Because it flies at around 400 feet, a user can also track its course on the app and get a notification when it lands.\", \"This means that in the future, lab technicians could autonomously use the app to send HIV tests from their remote villages to central hospitals, and get the results back in a timely manner.\", \"A lab technician from Kamuzu Central Hospital holds the UNICEF drone, flanked by Jim O\\u2019Sullivan, left, Matternet\\u2019s electronics lead, and Paola Santana, right, Matternet\\u2019s head of network operations.

Are these business imperatives really compatible with improving safety?\\n\", \"\\u201cYes, safety is fully congruent with those imperatives, but it depends on the time scale,\\u201d says Fabien Kritter, product manager at Hexagon Mining, a US -based IT company that specialises in integrated life-of-mine vehicle safety solutions connecting surveying, design, fleet management, production optimisation and collision avoidance.\", \"\\u201cThe current economic situation compels mines to produce more \\u2212 I have seen projects that extend 12-hour shifts by 30 minutes to increase production \\u2212 but the question is, what safety measures have been implemented to mitigate the increased risk resulting from these longer working hours?\\n\", \"\\u201cMines are dangerous places characterised by huge machines with terrible blind spots, heavy traffic, long shifts and monotonous journeys. If mines do not take preventive measures it is only a matter of time before an accident occurs and we live in a \\u2018zero harm\\u2019 society where fatalities are not tolerated.\\n\", \"\\u201cYet too often safety during mining operations is seen simply as a cost or investment; this is a short-term view. The cost of an accident in terms of loss of production due to machine downtime, repair and injury can rapidly reach several million dollars. In the worst-case scenario where there is a fatality and the mine has to close for a few days, that figure can jump to many millions of dollars.\\n\", \"\\u201cThe challenge is to find the right balance between production and safety, because they are linked. Technologies such as the SAFEmine CAS [Collision Avoidance System], FatigueMonitor and Vehicle Intervention System (VIS) can help operators accomplish their task and come home safe each day, despite intense work pressure.\\u201d\\n\", \"Unveiled at the MINExpo event in the US in September, the VIS is designed to add a further layer of protection to Hexagon\\u2019s CAS, which provides drivers of large vehicles with 360\\u00b0 proximity detection at any speed and in all conditions via cabin display units.\\n\", \"Installed in more than 25,000 vehicles in 55 mines, the CAS\\u2019 GPS unit calculates speed and path of movement so the operator can see where other vehicles are heading. The system\\u2019s in-built safety zone feature predicts potential collisions in advance and warns drivers using real-time traffic alerts.\\n\", \"\\u201cSAFEmine CAS improves safety and reduces metal contact by improving the situation awareness around vehicles by allowing operators to see vehicles that otherwise could not be seen,\\u201d explains Kritter. \\u201cHowever, incidents can still happen due to various factors such as human error and fatigue.\\n\", \"\\u201cThe VIS is the natural evolution of SAFEmine CAS and the initial impetus came almost three years ago when the Sishen mine operated by Anglo American Kumba Iron Ore contacted Hexagon. They had conducted an extensive risk assessment of their operation to understand their major risks and together with the customer we defined a step-by-step approach to develop a solution.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\", \"\\u201cThe VIS can take control of the machine in certain defined situations if the operator does not react appropriately to the initial warning provided by the CAS. The system can then act depending on the situation, either by inhibiting propulsion, activating the retarder or applying the service brake.\\n\", \"\\u201cVIS is fully integrated with Hexagon\\u2019s safety solution, and uses the same sensors and user interface to protect the customer\\u2019s initial investment,\\u201d Kritter continues. \\u201cWe worked closely with an OEM to make this vision of a last-resort system that mitigates the consequences of a collision a reality.\\u201d\\n\", \"Quantifying the comparative success of engineering safety systems and initiatives is tricky, primarily because mining operators are notoriously reticent about disclosing such data, as Kritter concedes.\\n\", \"\\u201cIn the long-term, safety is a good investment but it is difficult to quantify the return on investment, often because decision-makers are not aware of accidents prevented by such systems,\\u201d he says.\\n\", \"\\u201cHowever, a survey of over 540 operators indicated that 85% are confident that the SAFEmine CAS provides them with additional safety.\\n\", \"\\u201cAt the 2014 Queensland Mining Industry Health & Safety Conference, a company reported that in the 12 months prior to CAS installation, the mine experienced 14 machine-to-machine incidents. Afterwards, there were only two over the next two years, one involving a vehicle not equipped with the system, while in the other the system warned the operator but he did not react properly.\\n\", \"\\u201cCAS, FatigueMonitor and VIS not only prevent accidents, they also enforce better driving behaviour. For example, a small mine in Canada reduced small over-speed events [<10km/h] by 54% and over-speed events [>10km/h] by 100% after implementing the CAS.\\n\", \"\\u201cSpeeding also increases maintenance costs and can cause tire delamination. The Canadian mine realised a $300,000 in tire savings annually. Even if it is hard to quantify, I can confirm that overall the SAFEmine CAS has saved a couple of lives and several millions of dollars to mining companies.\\u201d\\n\", \"Despite these successes, is Kritter confident that the global mining industry is fully committed to the concept of \\u2018zero harm\\u2019 and that safety will not inevitably be sacrificed in favour of the bottom line?\\n\", \"\\u201cI am always extremely sad when a mining company that we have approached re-contacts us after a fatality,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt is a question of mentality. When the automobile industry introduced seat belts in the 1970s they took time to be accepted by drivers \\u2212 today, nobody would buy a car without them. In a few years, such safety systems will be the standard in the mining industry, I\\u2019m sure.\\u201d\\n\", \"Hexagon Mining has established itself as a major player in the field of life-of-mine optimisation. What other technologies does the company have in the pipeline and where is mining safety technology heading?\\u00a0\\n\", \"\\u201cHexagon Mining has many exciting projects in the pipeline,\\u201d he enthuses. \\u201cOne important development axis involves human-assist products, such as vehicle intervention and intelligent traffic management, both of which offer immediate operational value by lowering operating costs, increasing efficiency and enhancing operator safety.\\n\", \"\\u201cAnother developing field is mining digitalisation. Sharing and reporting the right data to decision makers means better and faster decisions, and better efficiency, better productivity.\\n\", \"\\u201cThere are many possibilities to improve information flow in a mine across all hierarchy layers, from the haul truck operators to the mine managers. It means data sharing of our multiple sensors and systems to provide smart reporting and deliver the right information to the right people when they need it.
